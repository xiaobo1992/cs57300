Five Star Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest.

Be prepared to eat.  

I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts.   Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I knew I was home.

It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  The dinner roll alone is a meal.  I can't say enough about dinner.  Everything is homemade. They don't add alot of salt, if any.  You can tell its fresh.  Its plentiful.  Its cheap.  You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.

You can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone.",review,5,Au3Qs-AAZEWu2_4gIMwRgw

I went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?

To begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  

Do not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.

The AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).

So give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.",review,4,idQx85xfiIm_SGTnDsaXcQ

Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. 

I gave it a shot and I was impressed! 

First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. 

The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. 

The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. 

Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. 

The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. 

Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.

The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.

A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. 

It's worth it though and I'll be back.",review,2,4AGRXB5C588iitXZY-y3wQ

I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. 

I have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time.

This review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  

When you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful ""contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained"" feeling afterwards.  

A quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The ""Philly"" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.

The best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.

The service is terrific, very fast and genuine. The coffee is hot and just right.

When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.

I really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  

I've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.

For those of you that take the good time to read my mediocre reviews, you'll know that I recently bought a fat bike. And I love it. Really, really love it.

But, I don't particularly enjoy the amount of water and crud those huge tires sling around. After my last ride, it felt like I was carrying around an extra 10-lbs of salty water weight, primarily in my bike shorts. Memories of a dirty diaper came to mind... 

So, I set about looking for fenders. I visited several bike stores in the area, none had what I was looking for in stock. So, I went online and ordered a set from Amazon. Who, eventually e-mailed me a ""whoops, sorry, those aren't in stock after all"" message. Curses!

Then I remembered that Revolution was just around the corner from my house, so I quick raced over to see if they had a set of fenders. And they did! Win!!

But... they were installed on a bike that was on the show floor. Fail!!

I inquired if they had extra fenders in stock - nope. 

I inquired if they would be interested in selling the ones from the show floor bike - yep!

Win again!!

And, because the fenders had been ""used"" (for one ride), they gave me an unnecessary, but greatly appreciated discount.

However, my friend was in town, and I thought, ""why the heck not? live a little!"" so I brought her here.

On our way to McDonald's, also known as ""Mickey D's"" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance.

However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!! 

We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places.  

As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax. 

I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken ""McNugget"" Pieces.

When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer. 
 
As the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it. 

Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste  

As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well.

I would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!!

Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo. 

Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone.

This is my favorite place to shop in Madison, and I've tried them all, many times.

Fresh-squeezed orange juice? Check. Decently priced bread? Check. Good produce? Check. Knowledgeable butcher? Check. Great wine selection & prices? Check. Not the Co-op? Check.

The problem with Woodman's is it sucks the life force out of you and makes you want to stick your head in a toilet, though goods are so cheap that you return again and suffer again and so on. The problem with the Co-op is . . . well, it's The Co-Op. Good for some things, important for ethically raised, locally sourced meat, but but but but but. 

Jenifer St. Market is a great local joint that really is a midway type of place. It's easy to get around in, which is probably its greatest strength. You can't find everything here, but you can find most things. I often find too much candy, but that's my own idiosyncratic problem. The wine selection is pretty good and the prices are really reasonable! I got two bottles last night, one white and one red, and didn't pay more than $12 for either. The meat counter is superb, though the ethical meat selection isn't so hot (they do sell Bare rotisserie chickens and Bell and Evans whole and pieced chickens, same as the Co-Op). 

Some downsides:

-Extremely annoying cash-only policy. There's a free ATM out front (you get charged $1 and then the machine gives you a $1 coupon). 

 -The market seems to have a policy of only hiring 16-year-old girls who have never packed a grocery bag or even bought groceries before. One girl once literally threw a tomato into my bag while I looked on with horror.",review,1,v3dbIu8qB2FuOJHOv_ZJrA

Besides that, I've never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn't really bother me.

Let me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I've had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.

Their cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I'd even go so far to say that it's one of the best burgers I've had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, ""Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,"" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.

I was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasn't a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn't until I'd eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, ""Das ist Deutsch"" in chocolate on the plate.  

I've had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, ""You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.""  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we don't tip you at all?

The diner theme is part of the aesthetic here, and my favorite dishes are the meat loaf, and the breakfast scrambles. My friend and I got two big breakfasts and the service was good on what looked like a crazy-busy Sunday brunch-rush. The coffee dude was keeping our cups full and warm as our server was moving past us bringing out amazing plates of super fresh food, yet always checking with us to see how we were doing. Busy, high quality standards, and lots of great cakes and pies if you have any room. I used to get the pie/cake to go, but not this time.

Coming from someone who's worked professionally in the food industry for the better part of the past decade, in bars, cafes, diners, organic kitchens, and hotels, this diner-style family eatery will always remain one of my absolute favorite places to go, for any meal of the day. This, more than any other restaurant in Madison, is what I missed when we moved away. 

Let's review:
1. One of the most creative, delicious, varied, and comprehensive vegetarian and vegan menus I've ever seen, especially for a place that specializes in heartwarming diner-style dishes. I'm a dedicated omnivore, and my favorite things to order off the menu were the Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight, and the Zucchini Potato Pancakes (both vegan).
2. The person who complained about the terrible service...I have no idea what she was talking about. In the 4 years I lived in Madison, I ate there on an average of once a month, and my servers were always friendly, responsive, and as prompt as could be expected during varied levels of busy-ness. 
3. The cook regularly comes out to chit-chat and joke with the customers. It's always a treat. :)
4. They work hard to support local farmers, with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce, meats and dairy from area growers. 
5. Their homemade biscuits are to DIE for.
6. Try the pies. And the cakes. Do it. If you can't eat another bite, take a slice home. I promise, you won't regret it!

The decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.

I got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she ""trusts me"".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.

My grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.

They seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.

Overall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.  I will definitely be back!",review,2,J-th6DPQi15QvsNxDj8AnA

My wife and I came here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed with any aspect.   Upon arrival we were met by the Inn Keeper, Pat who gave us a warm welcome and brief tour of the gust areas and our room.   The guest area, or as they call it, the ""gathering room"" is very warm & inviting.   Here you can sit to meet with others, read a book, select a wine, or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee, tea or soda with some light snacks available as well.   The freshly baked cookies are awesome.    There is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out.   

Our room, the ""Madison Lakes"" was outstanding.  Large, and outfitted extremely well. You will not be disappointed.  There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.   The bathroom is ginormous, with a large whirlpool tub, a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head, all of it being very nice.   

The grounds of the Inn is really a small farm, with fruits, veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast.    Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   

As my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.   So, we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine.    Ahhh... a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come.   

After a sound sleep and outstanding shower, we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well.  The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  

The attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   

Obviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!

We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter.

Seating is uncomfortable, and depending on where you're at the sun can be beating down on you for quite a while.

The activities and inning breaks definitely cater towards kids, but I found myself laughing, cheering, screaming wiener at the top of my lungs. Food in my opinion is only so, so. I like that there are local options but they're not great. They can't be... it's a ballpark and they're using prep kitchens. I will say the beer options are nothing short of amazing. I also dig that players typically stick around after the game and sign stuff for the little ones. It doesn't get more local than a Mallards game, except on July 4th of this year at the Hometown Classic. What's a Hometown Classic you ask?

I think it's really important to head in to your first (or any) mallards game with the right mind set. This isn't MLB! If you want that that head to a Brewers game in Milwaukee (NOT a Cubs game at Wrigley :p). 

As this is not MLB, the stadium is smaller and really easy to navigate through. I would imagine this would be really good for families looking for a night out. There is a decent sized kids area near the entrance as well. 

For a smaller stadium there is a really impressive amount of food and drink options. There are over 17 different beers available plus people selling Seagrams escape drinks (supposedly gluten free!), lime-a-Ritas etc. I was expecting pretty limited options for food as this is a smaller stadium but they really have everything you can get at an MLB game. Brats, burgers, chicken sandwiches, even cheese curds! There are even gluten free hamburger AND brat buns. Basically a food coma waiting to happen for anyone with celiac disease/gluten intolerance. The staff at all the food and drink stands was really friendly and quick!

 Like most Minor League teams, the Mallards kept us entertained with a wide variety of gimmicks. My Visit coincided with Fathers day so there was a meat raffle for the Dads that I gladly entered. I don't have any kids, but I wasn't going to let that get in between me and my meat. There was also a dance off between the Grounds Crew and a Mascot, t-shirt t throws and lots of other interesting side shows. Fans who catch foul balls can even trade it in for a free Hot Dog.

It's the kind of irrational fear I can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallow.

If you were there today, you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire, screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction, otherwise known as butterflies.  

I thought I could convince minor to hold my hand and ""trust"" that I wouldn't let anything bad happen, but apparently I'm a lousy saleswoman and/or my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent.  Dang!!!

Minor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave.  A wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car, far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing, face smashing butterflies of satan.

We walked in and while there was no hostess a really great brunette server welcomed us and sat us in her section that was immediately left of the bar area & first booth on the left. 

We ordered the salad which is pretty much a given drenched with dressing.  We asked if we could just get a piece of grilled chicken and al dente veggies our waitress said she would check. We never ask for special orders unless its clear that similar options are on the menu. She brought out a chef to hear what we wanted. We were blown away. She cared so much about getting the order right she got a chef out there. To his credit he rocked it. YUM! Grilled chicken & lightly cooked veggies were perfect.

+ Super cool dive bar that isn't really a dive bar
+ Very cozy inside, but in a really good way - feels ""homey"" and comfy
+ Awesome decor - the fixtures, the wood walls, the tin ceiling, the tables/chairs
+ Attention to detail like none other; little things make the whole (and they make it great)
+ Even the bathrooms are excellent

+ It's like the tap list was made just for me
+ Two nitro brews on tap, IPAs, Karben4, Upland - a really great mix
+ Super reasonable prices - $4 for excellent pints? Here's a $20; pry me off the floor when I'm done

+ Waitstaff was very responsive, very prompt, and super friendly

- So noisy; sound really carries in the place

Grabbed a small table near the back/side wall. Ben, the owner, introduced himself and was so welcoming, gracious, and sincere. He's done an amazing job with this place and I'm confident it's going to be a smashing success. I love that it's just a few blocks from my house, because I know I'm going to be here often. Can't wait to try the food - the menu sounds and looks like a perfect match to the neighborhood, while honoring the spirit of the joint.

We were there the week it opened and I enjoyed a few creative cocktails. My husband, a beer aficionado, loved the beer list, which includes 2 nitro taps.

We were there again last night with friends for the fish fry. When I read the menu, I was intrigued by the Rooster sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg. I'm so glad I tried this instead of the fish because it was really good. It's such a large sandwich, though, it is probably better to split with a friend. I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)! If you love bacon, this is the sandwich for you!

My husband had the fish, which was a nice piece of walleye and perfectly fried. He doesn't normally like cole slaw but specifically noted how much he liked the slaw. He also liked the tartar sauce, and said it was enhanced with dill.

The beer list isn't huge but it's got all the best of the bunch and changes often. The noise level can be challenging, given the small size of the place and the fact that it's usually packed. 

Love the interior, very art deco-ish in blues, greens and golds, warm and inviting. The service is friendly, attentive and prompt. The fried pickles are a must-have appetizer, they're slices rather than spears, and the batter is a light tempura style. They're served with the Tip Top sauce, a spicy sriracha aeoli. Delish.

What a great find! I drove by this place on my way to work for a YEAR and never thought to stop in. At a glance, it doesn't seem like much. Nestled(snugly) between two other buildings you can almost miss it. 

I'm so glad we stopped in! It has that true BBQ joint atmosphere- checkered cloth tables(each complete with it's own roll of paper towels), wood paneling, and Southern blues playing overhead. You order at the counter off of a big overhead wood sign, and they bring piles of saucy goodness to your table. This place is littered with awards for their barbecue. I guess the owner travels and competes(and a lot of times, wins) at national cook-offs.

I got the 1/3 slab rib and beef brisket combo. The ribs were super yummy. Flavor-full, but not too smokey. The brisket was nice too, not too fatty. I would say that the house sauce has that vinegar-like tang. It's sweet and spicy and tart all at the same time. Nice. 

My saucy side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, which we both thought was good...but nothing amazing. The sides were really tasty too. The beans were delish, and the sugar-buns(read: fried dough dusted with confectioners' sugar) weren't too bad either.

We both left with tingling tongues, full bellies, and smiles on our faces.

My friend is a UW student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat. We ordered the brisket, rib and chicken. The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy. I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. 

I tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout. My friend placed an order of the 'doughnuts' as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits. We waited and waited, ordered them to-go and even then they weren't ready. The counter-man, who must have been the manager then asked the unseen Forrest what was going on with the damn sugar fried biscuits and then said he was going to give back the money for the biscuits.

I went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn. If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9

At $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!

I think this place is best for carryout. You can sit and eat - there are a handful of tables, but then there are also bullet holes in the windows. Since it's Madison, I'm assuming someone put them there for show, but definitely with a real gun, so anyway I'd rather eat at home.

Luxury is Bentleys and Beverly Hills; bone-in filets and ""bon appetite"". Luxury is throwing some glitter and making it rain.

I once thought luxury in its truest form was to only be attainable by the rich and the powerful - but boy was I wrong. People -- luxury IS attainable. I know this, because I recently experienced it at the Country Inn and Suites outside of Madison, WI. 

 Whether you opt for an ""inn"" or spring for a ""suite"" - you're going to love this fucking hotel. Upon entering the palatial lobby, a charming bellman presented me with my own personal luggage dolly, even though it was clear that my strapping, young body was more than adequate to carry my small, nylon duffle bag. The Sconnie at the front desk even put me up on the top floor of the resort (floor 3), which offered views of one of the most gorgeous bodies of water I had ever seen. 

The ice bucket was a nice touch. It was large, though not too large as to take up much of the expansive counter space the room provided. There was even a plastic liner for the bucket--which I scoffed at. To think, who would even consider using it in such a pristine, meticulously manicured suite? I quickly tossed it, and when I did I couldn't help but notice the luxurious mini-fridge down below. Let me tell you, there was nothing ""mini"" about this fridge. I fit an entire case of Coors Light in there, along with some Gatorade, and cheese curds to boot. It looked so cool and cozy that, at the end of the evening, I wanted to curl up and sleep in there.

Though it wasn't easy -- I refrained from sleeping in the mini-fridge. I mean, how could I sleep in there with one of the most luxurious beds I had ever seen staring me in the face? You could fit John, Kate, and the 8 on this bed. I never would, though. I'd kick them all out and keep all of the fresh pillows and down comforters to myself-- because THAT'S luxury, and Kate is mean. If it wasn't for a call of nature which I battled until my bladder nearly exploded on all of the luxurious bedding, I might STILL be laying in that fluffy wonderland of extravagance. 

Now, I've peed in some nice bathrooms... very nice bathrooms actually. Once, I came across a bathroom SO nice, I couldn't pee in there. I held it, and peed in my less fortunate bathroom at home-- but this bathroom? This bathroom was so luxurious; I HAD to pee in it. I couldn't unzip my fly fast enough (literally, I peed a little in my pants). Thankfully there was a cornucopia of fine soaps and lotions at my disposal. I would bet that royalty uses these same soaps - they just had that royal smell about them. When I was done drying my hands, I squirted a little more of that soap on them and didn't even wash it off.

Summary: In hindsight, this is really only a place you want to stay at if you're celebrating something really special-- a honeymoon, for instance, or a significant wedding anniversary. I would've stayed someplace else had I known the Country Inn and Suites was so luxurious. Now, back at my home, I fear I may never taste that royal tang again. Enjoy your stay here; cherish it.

It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.

It was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).

Safeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.

Of course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).

As for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music. I almost feel like if I came in sweatpants and a t-shirt that I would be under-dressed to get groceries.

Whole Foods ain't got nothing on Metcalfe's (leave my double negative alone).",review,1,ETsGHcgJxldK9rlVXVB9lA

Office employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.  

The food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go.
Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce. 

The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.

Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want ""more curry"", ""spicier"" or ""hotter"" you only need to ask. 

Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.

Drink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea. 

It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.

The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken.

Learn it. Order it. Love it.

It's mussel soup. I don't care if you don't like seafood, you will love this. You might think it's just sauce that the mussels are served in. It's soup. You will drink it, and you will wipe up every last drop with your fingers. There is nothing else like it. I'm serious. This is the stuff late-night cravings are made of. 

The pad thai is good, but you can experiment here, ask the waitress for ideas, and know that you'll end up with something different and exciting. There are a few dishes that are acquired tastes (I'm learning to love wild boar), but because I eat here, I get to say ""I eat wild boar!"" and it makes me sound like a better person. And I'm pretty sure eating wild boar does make me a better person, at least to Lost groupies.

My main criticism is that they can sometimes hold back on the heat. It's not enough to say you want it hot. They'll assume you mean ""American hot."" Make sure to specify ""Thai hot."" The burn is good.

You must save room for dessert. This is essential. It will show you another side of Thai you may not have experienced before. I wouldn't go here just for desert, but drinks + dessert = win.

The inside is white tablecloths and candles. This is where you take a date, where the hostess will make sure you're happy and the waitresses will keep your glass always full. And you can see the kitchen from every table, so it feels like you're taking your date to a favorite neighborhood family restaurant (you are, and it is).  The only problem is the bar, which usually has a few sad people at it. I like to think it just adds to the neighborhood feel.

The patio is fun, with great seating arrangements, misters, and a vibrant atmosphere during the evening (don't sit here for lunch). It can be a little difficult to get service on the patio unless it's already packed. If you're with friends who want to hang out, choose the patio. It's great for spending the evening, with good drink service and lively conversation going on all around you.

Finally, this is on a light rail stop, so there is absolutely no excuse not to make it part of your night out.",review,2,P8KlUtWEu-b6ZwM7XjuxBg

Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  

The restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.  We will definitely be back as this will be our new home for Thai in the valley.",review,1,fDGhrZ59p4fV2tBMv5HCXg

The Pad Thai and Panang were both spiced to perfection and the service was great and our waitress was so friendly and helpful I wanted to come back the very next day.

The Temple of the Thaiger- delicious and described as a party in your mouth, and it was. Perfectly seasoned chicken layered on fried won tons.

Satay Sampler- This was shrimp, chicken, and beef covered in a peanut sauce and was very yummy.

Freshie Rolls- we had the chicken and the veggie and both were soooooo good, this is a must try !

Jasmine rice- steamed to perfection.

All food is made to order and is fresh and delicious. This is a family owned and operated business with Thai born chefs that really know what they're doing.

I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. 

This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. 

As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).

No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).

Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)

Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)

The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) 
You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. 

There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. 

I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.

The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  

We started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. 
For dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing.

It was bizzare rolling up in a RVCA tee and a pair of cargos and Reefs while the other partrons were having some kind of Royal Family flashback in their feathery headpieces and pinkys skyward.

But whatever.  I ALWAYS sat outside under their very large oak(?) trees that shade most of their front area.

They would eventually mosey over to Teeter ... good for them!

Anyhow, back to this sandwhich.  Its unbeleivable and pretty large with a side of rosemary potato salad and some fruit.  Teeter house also serves beer and wine, which was always nice.  They have a pretty good selection too.

St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. 

I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. 

During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. 

Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony.

Importantly realizing that Native American cultures are not dead, the museum contains modern artwork and filmed interviews with members of today's Native American tribes. The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.

One could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. 

A final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world ""beautiful"" to describe any building in Phoenix.

We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the ""children's area"" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.

Adult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, ""oh that's OK"" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.

The story of the various Native American tribes is an incredibly solemn one that is all too often glazed over in your average grade school American History course.  I was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - For 200 years, Native Americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man's version of civility.  Not until the 1960's (and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the Native American Languages Act) has the United States finally reversed course and decided to protect the various Native American cultures.  Sad, but true, and something your average American probably doesn't know and likely doesn't want to know or care to know.

Thankfully there are places like the Heard Museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the Southwest.  I feel it is unduly categorized as an ""Art Museum"" by many instead of an ""American History"" museum.  Yes, you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and Kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing, the traditional cooking, the language component, and most importantly the history lesson.  If you leave here thinking, ""that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls"" then you've totally missed the point.

The first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe.  Obviously there are many similarities, but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes.  It also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when I was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern Native American art (sculpture and paintings and jewelry).  There is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend, often far from their homes and at extremely young ages, to strip them of their cultural heritage.  My favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit, likely meant for children but I couldn't keep away from it.  So what if I'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower?  There is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-American indigenous art and garb.

It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.

I was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...

The Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. 

The founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.

Most people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.

So, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright. It isn't all pools, spas, baseball and golf after all.",review,19,VDHUtEnPh54OJiYow91d3A

You can easily walk around here and explore all the exhibits and after a few hours still not have seen it all. So many different tribes are represented here. Baskets, bowls, artwork, clothing, dolls, ceremonial outfits, kachinas, and more from many tribes are on display.

What is impressive is that most of the pieces on display are donated by private collectors. Senator Barry Goldwater's collection of about 400 kachinas were donated and on display among many others who gave to the museum. There are also free hourly tours by knowledgeable museum staff. There is even a children's area with hands on crafts, exhibits, and learning tools.

Heard never fails to satisfy my history itch.  There are a number of permanent exhibits and they change things up a bit every so often to give you a good reason to return. Visit their website to see what's going on.  I don't know how many artifacts and pieces of Native American and Southwest art they have in their collection, but it's certainly in the thousands.

It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!

I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.  I am passionate about this school.

I will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?  

My son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  

We were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.

And, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  

He loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.

Then the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.

The school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.

Driver was friendly and did a great job at sensing our eagerness to get to the airport (as now it is about 30 minutes later than our original pick up time with Discount!).  He didn't gripe about how many suitcases we had and was beyond courteous and polite.

We will call Yellow Cab again before we ever call Discount.",review,0,JQsyLbRcUGM1Z4zYrI3nOQ

There were 5 of us checking in and we had a small room that was going to be tight but we were going to make it work when the girl behind the counter let us know that the suite was available and it had more room. She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. 

The room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. 

The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed. Obviously being a historical landmark it is older and smaller than the gigantic contemporary resorts that many of us are now used to, but it's so much better in many ways. It was warm and friendly and felt like a loved one's home. Honestly I would stay there again anytime. 

There is talk about it being haunted but I didn't get a scary vibe from the hotel at all. I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor. The doors opened revealing the basement and I said ""Hello?"" There was no one around. It kind of creeped me out a little bit later when I found out more about the history of the hotel and it's haunting stories. 

I highly recommend the Hotel San Carlos for those of you who appreciate history and don't mind a hotel with character.

As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. 

If I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. 

Service is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor.

I loved you when you were also The Crystal Palace.  I loved you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag us back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells. 

You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).

And what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.  

Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.

Comedor Guadalajara is a place that seems to always come up when discussing Phoenix Mexican food.  I finally found myself in the area and dropped by for early lunch and was not disappointed.

To the tourists and over cautious it may not look like the best area to be but have no worries.  This part of town is just old and run down.  You won't be knifed in the parking lot and there's even a security guard keeping an eye on the lot.  Have no fears.

As per usual when I hit a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  The appetizer was the standard free house chips and salsa.  Oh, boy!  The salsa!  I always complain that the salsa in not hot enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite here and there was a temporary spice assault upon my eyes and nose.  Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.

My food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.

The dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.

Sadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.

I'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.

Arriving about 11 AM today, a Tuesday, this nice, fairly large place was already roaring busy!  I did get seated right away, but they were soon full, with quite a crowd in the waiting room by the time I left.

For this visit I decided on one of the four white board Lunch Specials of the Day (in addition to the Tuesday Lunch Special contained in the printed restaurant menu).  This was a Pablano Chile Relleno and Pechuga Asada (broiled, boneless chicken breast).

My friendly server gal showed up right away with good toasted tortilla chips and a cup of their spicy hot, pureed red salsa.  Next came a small bowl of their Soup of the Day, which was Conchigliette y Carne Deshebrada in a tomato based sauce.  Yum!  (Having soup included witl lunch at no extra charge is one of things that make this place special!) 

At the right time, my big platter of the main courses arrived.  Everything was beautifully placed, & the chile came stuffed with Queso Oaxaca, breaded, deepfried, and treated to some delicious toppings.  Along side was the tasty, good-sized chicken steak plus generous servings of creamy tasting, cheese coated refried beans & fluffy Spanish Rice.

Every bite of this meal was absolutely delicious, and again I wish I had brought my camera along to show it off, but suffice it to say that I'm so glad I came to this great restaurant today!     :-))

I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.
From the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.
After what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.
Then fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.
Even after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.
Everything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.

You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!

Anyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.

Oh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.

On top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid.

 the teriyaki bowls are serious. not skimping on portions at all. and if you seriously off a diet, they have double meat portions. :D    i like the dark meat chicken version. drop on a heavy sprinkling of the hot powder and some black sesame seeds.

However , they do charge extra for the little things. Like making it extra spicy is like .35 extra and brown rice is a little extra, I mean barley enough to where you would even notice.

They have soup, and sushi, salad,etc.

Fate is my favorite restaurant.  i discovered it late one night (well, early morning, actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown.  I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.?).  He insisted that I'd be amazed, and I was.  

I have had to wait a few times to get in, but usually that was because it was First Friday.  It's understandable, because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown), and it's pretty popular.  Besides, you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait.  It's not a big deal.

I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing yellow curry too. They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, but perfectly so.

Finally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says ""Wigs"" and out popped a tiny Asian woman who whisked us inside.

We walked into wig heaven. Every length , every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows of wigs. 

I was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of her wigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said "" Are you going to buy a wig today""? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO !!!

On my most recent visit, I had a Meat Lover's plate--2 Sicilian meatballs, an Italian sausage, and penne pasta, all in a fantastic meat sauce.  Probably the best plate of pasta I've had in a LONG time.

Fill that out with minestrone soup, hot sourdough with butter, and attentive service, and you have a great meal.  My wife and daughter like the mizithra cheese pastas--not my taste, but they enjoy it, and that's all that matters.  

Plus, an Italian dinner for 4 for about fifty-something dollars is pretty kickass.  I'm absolutely a fan of the OSF.  After trying Italian food all over the Phoenix area for months, this location is still, as of now, my pick for the best pasta in the Valley.

We were celebrating our oldest foster daughters 8th birthday. So my wife, our two foster kids, and myself met our daughter and her boyfriend here. We had a 6:30 reservation, we were actually there early. This is were I had the only problem of the evening. When we first arrived, I told them who I was and we are early. The hostess said that we were going to need to wait for our reservation time. While I was in shock, I asked her. So if we just walked in now and asked for a table, we would be seated now? This is when she said one moment so she can talked to her supervisor. She sat us when she came back and apologized. I told her there was no apology needed. She asked us if we needed them to keep the birthday cake Denise baked in storage which was very helpful.
Natalie the birthday girl was in awe on the decor of the restaurant and very excited that we ate in the trolley. I ordered the gluten free baked chicken and pasta. It was better then I thought it was going to be. At my age, I am trying healthier food options. Although the chicken was a little dry, pasta was very good. The two girls had spaghetti and meat sauce and had no complaints from them. Not going into detail on what everyone else had, but there was no complaints from them either. When we were finished, they came out with the cake, ice cream, and sang Natalie the birthday song. I believe this is going to be a great memory for her. I know that Natalie never had the chance to experience things like this. Something that myself and very many people take for granted!

They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe.

This is dorky - but I know you'll totally get me if you've ever trekked across countless useless square feet in heels, lugging countless brochures and promos you've been given; if you've trampled over mounds of used paper towels in a depressingly lit, dingy bathroom; if you've ever had to sit in a hard plastic chair for an hour+ and listen to a rumple-suited guy drone on and on about synergy and sales figures; if you've ever been subjected to ugly corporate art ... OK, I'll stop there - but I LOVED the Phoenix Convention Center!

With a swell new renovation, its gorgeous in contemporary rust and sand and other deswet appropriate colors (god, I'm glad Arizona finally got away from the ""sunset"" color scheme of pink, purple, orange - blech!) and fancy tile entryway. It's clean, modern and has TONS of windows and open space. When you enter the West Building from Second St (the entrance by Starbucks), you're sort of swept up, up, up to the sky, and it really makes a statement (the entire entryway/first floor is open all the way to the top).

The seminar rooms have all the hi-tech gadgets needed for presentations, and the AV/Tech guys were professional and prompt if there was a problem - and, might I add, some of the most well-dressed techies I've ever encountered. No band T-shirts, visible tattoos or bears* here, man, it was all long-sleeved button-down shirts and dress pants; impressive!

My favorite part? Wicked-comfy chairs in the rooms. No hard plastic and metal legs, no cumbersome, heavy, office-gray uncomfortable torture devices. The chairs were super sleek - those mesh-back, rolling office-desk chairs you always see in design studios and architecture offices. By the way, did I mention the backs *recline*. I'm totally serious. I'm a super antsy chair sitter - I sit up, I slide down, I cross, re-cross, pull my legs up Indian-style, under me, I turn (doubly insulting to speakers if the chairs are squeaky)... I can never sit still in an office chair, but these bad boys made me feel like a grown up finally as I could sit quietly for a full hour.

Bathrooms were incredibly nice - large-tiled floors that were actually clean, small-tiled sink backsplash in contemporary colors, soap AND paper towels in full supply AND the automatic water faucets ACTUALLY all worked! It's a convention center miracle! A full-length mirror for making sure your conference appropriate attire looks as nice as you thought it did at 5 this morning. Nice, floor to ceiling, all-glass (frosted) doors with the long bar, brushed steel handle (what can I say? I'm a sucker for a cool bathroom, just read any of my reviews)

What else.. it's right off the light rail, of course. I found the entrance easily, no wandering around an entire city block looking for the right door. Up on the third floor, the windows provide a great view of the city streets - p.s. what's with the towering TMobile ad painted right on the Bank of America building?? Oh yes, super hi-tech looking TV screens outside each room that display in color the current and upcoming sessions - helpful, because it never fails that someone moves or changes the signs and you're left wondering if you're in the right place. 

Also, I liked that the convention center chose to work with a caterer who uses compostable plastic cups made from corn...say what?? And they have recycle cans alongside regular trash cans for all those empty water bottles.

OK, the one thing this place does have in common with other convention centers is that it is FREEZING. Of course, that is to be expected no matter where you travel.

I was really glad I ended up choosing them because my experience was really great. 

To start with, when I emailed the online quote request, I got a prompt - and very thorough - response from Jeff. Unlike some businesses that respond to quote requests with a zillion other questions, Jeff took a stab right away at specs/materials and an estimate. This made me so much more likely to engage and really saved me a lot of back-and-forth (which I just don't have time to do during the work week). 

When I picked up the signs, they were great quality and the work was as I pictured it. I also thought the prices were reasonable for custom signs.

After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies?  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4.75 stars
Service - 3.75 stars
Overall - 4.5 stars

This is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.

The sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, eh?

Our main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. 

Bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  

Price for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.

My only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. 

I'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.",review,5,4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA

My husband and I went in on a Saturday night for a few glasses of wine.  Once we saw the desserts, however, we knew we had to try it!  I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was very good (it wasn't the Harvard Faculty Club, but then again...what is?) and my husband selected the coconut pie.  Both servings were huge and covered in whipped cream.  They were fantastic.  Finally, a place to go for dessert here!

We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender was amazing.  He offered us complimentary tastings of two delicious dessert wines and then even offered us a complimentary mini cheese sampler with an amazing sheep's milk cheese.  The atmosphere was perfect, it was laid back, kind of cafe/bistro-ish but still modern.  They were playing The Food Network which I absolutely loved...I've never seen that in a restaurant before! It was a great touch.   The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced.

They have a wonderful wine dinner with four courses for only $55 a person!  I'm eager to attend one in the future and I definitely plan on going back for dinner in the near future.

Comfortably situated on Central Avenue slightly south of McDowell, it's a quiet, chic space that I think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months. The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the ""wine by the glass"" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.

The first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  

I most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.  Prices are very reasonable for both wine and food.

My initial review of 5 stars has not changed.  Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer.   I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there.  It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for.  A full dinner? Sure.  Just dessert? You got it.  A small nosh? Why not.   I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a ""regular"" entree.  It is not to say that they aren't good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu.  

My favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin.  This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list.  Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats.  Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature.  This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off.  The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese.  (Really, any of their mac and cheese options are great).

He provided some of the best service I have received period, which is a lot to say because I go out to eat frequently. I will definitely be returning and bringing my friends and requesting him.

The food was just as great as the service. We went for restaurant week, so we each did the $30 dealio that comes with three courses. I did the poached pear salad, salmon, and the peach cheesecake. We also decided to try their mac and cheese because we had heard good things about it. The mac and cheese (we got the pesto and spinach one) was TO DIE FOR. I am salivating just thinking about it. I love me some mac and cheese so I am always excited to find really good ones. They also had a couple other options to choose from that I definitely will be back to try.

I have lived in CenPho for several years now and have only just tried Cheuvront in the last four months or so. I mistakenly assumed it was a pretentious wine restaurant but truthfully, it is far from it. 

My first foray was at a Sunday Italian cheese tasting they held over the summer. Around $15-$18, you sampled pre-selected cheeses and had the option of ordering a wine flight with it or anything else to drink. You could also order other food. The tastings began at 3pm, and the best part was the restaurant officially opened at 4pm which began their 4-6pm daily happy hour. Yes, DAILY. Great HH selection, too, between the drinks and food. I am a fan of the one cheese plate for $5, margherita flatbread ($6, I think) and their goat cheese phyllo pockets with a balsamic sauce. God, those are to die for. On the dinner menu, we also tried a bleu cheese mac and cheese that was delicious. 

Since the first cheese tasting, I have been to an American cheese tasting, and most recently a Spanish cheese tasting. It was at the American cheese tasting that I discovered a favorite goat cheese with the consistency of a parmesan. Cheuvront sells their cheeses for about $1.50 an ounce which is very reasonable. I also had a fantastic red sangria that I had to stop at 2 for. So good.

I was impressed at the extensive cheese list. I lived in France for two years & this compares very well to a fromagerie in France with all the different cheeses. The staff is all quite nice and knowledgable on the menu of cheeses and wines to pair with. We selected three cheeses and asked to pair with the suggested wines. I was very impressed. The cheese plate is paired with fruits and a scatter of almonds to cleanse the palate between cheeses. My boyfriend ordered the risotto for his entree and he was asked if he wanted salmon or chicken ... It wasn't a small amount of salmon as one would expect
, but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta. Rarely do I finish my entire entree , but this meal was heaven in my mouth. For dessert we shared a piece of hazelnut torte and champagne. Perfect date night and worth the extra workout. The staff is wonderful and the ambience is romantic.

My bed was comfortable and room service cleaned everyday, placing things just where I left them if they need to making the bed or cleaning the sink. I was able to control the heat in the room! Big screen tv with hbo. Coffee maker in the room, iron in the room and FREE WIFI were a plus!

I also loved the workout room. While small, they had a few machines that could keep this girl happy.

Breakfast was great and full of hot/cold selections. Not only pastries, but egged, bacon, cinnamon rolls, cereal, oatmeal, biscuits, ect.

Location wise, this hotel was only 7 min walk to the convention center. It is not far from the airport. I would save money by riding on the metro rail and walking down if you have carry-on, as the $24 dollar shuttle was not worth the distance to/ from the airport, but that's just me being cheap.

Also make sure and arrive slightly early, while they might not care about how you're dressed, etc. I promise you they absolutely will not let you to the hall after the doors close, you will be stuck in the lobby until the intermission.

It's something everyone should go to at least once, even if you think it's not for you.  And don't buy into the tales of these evildoers that wander around Yelp complaining there is no culture in Phoenix.  The musicians are talented, at least in this tone-deaf Yelper's humble opinion.

We've gone to a few performances.  The Mr. prefers the Classical series which is enjoyable even if sometimes I want to take a nap.  I prefer the Pop series.  And mixed in with this are a variety of holiday performances (the Hocus Pocus Halloween performance was really entertaining!)  On the plate for next Spring...an Elvis tribute.  Yep, I'll be there.  Also Simon & Garfunkel and McCartney/Beatles tributes, and music from the 30's & 40's.  

Now between all that and the Classical stuff, there really is something for everyone.

Not clogged with bitterness or bottom lines.  Stress?  Sure.  But in the service of something eternal.  The music.  Which lasts when administrations and trends are gone, and flashes in the pan are revealed as pyrite.  Speaking of eternal, the particular piece she was discussing was Beethoven's fifth.  And I learned something!  Real pros don't call it Beethoven's fifth. They call it ""Beethoven Five"".  Can you imagine composing something that the best talents of subsequent ages compete with each other to try to do honor to? She also discussed the ruddy earthy tambre of another piece, and those words resonated because I was careening across a stretch of Arizona's ruddy desert at that point and I felt her words echo the landscape.

More drinks and a plate of prosciutto and another round were ordered. By this time we were able to move to a large wooden table that had become vacant. 

The food came out and it was perfect. Buttery crostini and paper thin prosciutto. Perfect amount of food to wet your appetite. The atmosphere inside the bar was very laid back and soothing. The prices weren't too bad either. 4 drinks and an app came to $20. Not too bad I thought. This would be a great place to go hang out on any night and not have to worry about a table next door.

I've been both with my nephew and with fellow ""big kids"" aka adults. Every time I go, I have a blast and it's not necessary to borrow your friend's child in order to find an excuse to go. The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. 

During past visits, I've enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! 

Currently, they have an exhibit called ""Forces of Nature"" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively. I won't give it away, but you could get stuck in some rainy weather! 

Just recently, I was giving a super secret sneak peak into the brand new exhibit launching on 9/27 called ""All About Me."" They've been working on this exhibit for at least a year if not longer and it certainly shows! The amount of thought and energy they put into each exhibit is incredible and it's an extremely dynamic experience. Throughout the exhibit, I ""x-rayed"" a body and learned about different body parts, I entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system (no pun intended) and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down. I placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart! Needless to say, the exhibit excited me and while I definitely am still a kid at heart, it was the adult in me who couldn't wait to come back and explore some more. 

Before I go, I want to share some other favorites that the Science Center offers...the Imax and Adults Night Out! They have a state of the art, full size Imax theater on site and they show movies like Under the Sea. I am a big fan of the Imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here.

Now back to the pirate exhibit, holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at 400 million dollars!  The have tons of real ""pieces of 8"" they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of Cape Cod.  There was their silverware, belt buckles, guns, cannons, gold, silver, rope, and I can go on forever.  It was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff.

If I was just rating the museum I'd give it 4 stars. They've got a great variety of hands on activities, but I do get strange looks when I get in line to try them,,,,, & everyone else is of elementary school age :D For this reason, if you are NOT in elementary school & you will not be taking young kids, I would recommend trying to go during school hours. That way you get to try all the hands on activities :) & they are fun!! 

There is an IMAX theater & Planetarium on the first floor. 
On the second floor (I'm pretty sure of the location) there is a SKY CYCLE.... sooo cool! I'm afraid of heights and have yet to take the ride, but one day soon, it's gonna happen! lol! If you or your kids want to do it you have to meet the height requirements, fit into the harness & you need to wear tennis shoes. No high heels or flip flops ladies :)
There's a rock climbing wall,,, but for the life of me I can't recall what floor it's on,,, but it's there. 

I would recommend grabbing a bite before or after the museum. They have a little cafe on the first floor, but I would leave that for emergencies, like your blood sugar dropping or a toddler who must have a cookie :)

Research has shown that positive relationships between ""Littles"" and their ""Bigs"" have a direct and measurable impact on children's lives. They are more confident in school, better able to get along with their families and peers, and less likely to begin using alcohol and drugs.

One of the reasons this program works so well is the dedication of the matchmakers. Their extensive interview and screening process ensures the best matches possible, which are based on similar backgrounds, interests and hobbies. 

What I've discovered during my time as a Big is that I get as much out of our relationship as my Little. He's an awesome kid that just needs a male role model in his life, and I am proud to be the one to be able to provide it. We've bowled, gone to the Arizona Science Center, the planetarium, watched movies, sometimes we just hang out and play video games.

The commitment they ask for is just a few hours two to four times a month, for a minimum of 6 months. Of course the longer the better - many matches remain friends for life.

Ok, now I'm going to wrap up by quoting Whitney Houston in a Yelp review (which a fellow Yelper bet me a Cornish Pasty I'd never be able to find a justifiable reason for doing so)...

Your experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.

As you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. 
This should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. 

Their chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.

Every item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. 

What I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. 

Here's my suggestion.
Go on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.

The food, ambiance, service are all superb.

I've written a fair amount of reviews and this one is likely to sound gushy enough to make my wife jealous.

Their chips are made fresh.  Not made fresh that day.  MADE FRESH FOR YOU, right when you order them.  They charge $1 for a very large basket.  Salsa is free.

The only thing I am not a fan of there is their red salsa, but thier green is so damn good and so damn hot.  I pay, but its worth it.

Ok, now the beans. Oh my God!  They are so creamy and perfect.  I highly suggest you order a side to go along with your chips.  I live a solid 30 miles from this place and will drive here JUST for the beans.  My wife loves beans so much.  Its almost unnatural.  She could seriously sit down with a plate of beans, thats it, and be happy.

She get absoluely giddy when she knows we are gonig here.

Rellenos.  Oh my God AGAIN.  I can't even describe how wonderful they are.  They really are unlike any other restaurant's I've ever had.  First off, they are huge. Secondly they use a batter that fries up so light and puffy.  So you have this slightly crisy, kinda fluffy exterior surrounding strips of relleno pepper with the most luscious, ooey gooey cheese in the center.  I dump a ton of their green salsa on top and just go to town.  All you'll here from me are moans and sighs or delight once it is put in front of me until I'm done.  They actually continue a god 30 minutes after I leave as I replay the feast in my mind.  WOW

The chicken enchiladas are perfection, the machaca is oh so good, tacos are cripsy goodness.

Here's my order...  Chips with green salsa and a side of beans while I wait for my a la cart cheese relleno and either a chicken enchilada with green sauce (not salsa) or a machaca taco.  Depends on what mood I'm in.

If I eat the whole thing for lunch.  I don't eat dinner.

but...Wow, i didn't realize how lucky i was to beat the lunchtime crowd here. I have been meaning to go here for several months, but like our first reviewer, can't go out of my way when during their normal biz hours.

but, i had heard so much about it, i like green so much that i jumped at the chance to stop by after a rare 10 a.m. downtown meeting. i got there at about 11:30 and there was plenty of parking (by plenty i mean only three of the lots 10 or so spots were occupied), but, even though i knew what the building looked like from driving past its closed doors so many times before, i still cruised right on past while heading south on 7th st. i went into the second entrance to the lot that wraps behind the building and oops! that's an exit only. i had to do some fancy manuevering and a 3-point-turn (haven't lost my skills since driving test '98 - woot!) to face the right way and get into a spot.

normally, i would be pretty annoyed at all this, but i was too excited to try a refreshing vegetable-heavy wrap on such a damn hot day. and that's a wrap! did not disappoint. while i waited for my companion, i looked over the menu and was surprised at how many of the items were hot or grilled. i was kind of heartbroken until i saw the daily special, chicken salad with avocado, lettuce, veggie mayo in a flavored wrap (all the tortillas are flavored, making the choosing process that much more painstaking).

once i had my order on lockdown, i checked out the art on the walls of this early 1900's house-turned cafe. not my taste (the subjects were robotic kind of monsters with drippy limbs, i thought of pink floyd the wall, while my friend likened it to what a 15 yr old metal head stoner doodles during class) although they had skateboard art, also, which was better. then i picked up a java magazine and flipped through it...basically, if you come alone, you won't look like a loser, there's plenty to keep you busy.

blah blah blah - long story short, the wrap was great, although on sides menu i chose ""house chips"" thinking they would homemade potato chips, but were just store bought tortilla chips. lame. friend got the pasta salad which was much better, i recommend that. plus, they cut the burrito sandwich in half and have bags and plastic wrap right there at the drink station, so you can easily get two meals (hence my being happy at round #2) and i was happy i didn't have to 
 a. wait in line forever just to get my wrap travel-appropriate

I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the ""Godfather"" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- 
dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!

I see complaints that ppl think it's expensive, me thinks not. If you go to any other lunch time ""quick bite"" place you'll pay about the same amount (or more), unless you're talking about a franchise fast food spot. 

This place is right around the corner from where I work so I like to zip over here when I've forgot lunch or too lazy to make it. I almost always get the Turk 182 b/c I love artichokes and the Muenster cheese. I decided to branch out and tried the Sherry A'More. YUM! I don't think the food is bland, and I like flavor. I don't think they all taste the same either....the garlic rice in some of the wraps is great, and I normally don't like rice in wraps.

I had ""The Fin"" it was a tuna wrap, but not canned tuna, cooked tuna full of marinated flavor, accompanying it was a mango salsa, purple cabbage slaw and garlic white rice in a red tortilla. I opted for the jalapeno cabbage soup of the day as my included side. For $7.25

Fresh delicious ingredients that are actually healthy for you.. and I love nothing more than healthy food that doesn't taste healthy at all.. for instance, the teriyaki 90210.. Grilled teriyaki chicken, crunchy veggies, fresh ginger slaw & jasmine rice.. amazing! Rocky VII, who doesn't love cheese-steak?? Not the healthiest choice they have to offer, but goddamn delicious. Ive also tried the Gringo Star which is the mexicany wrap and The Godfather with salami, ham and my favorite, provolone. I usually get the pasta salad to accompany my lunch, which is also, very yummy. Ive literally never tried anything here my mouth didn't instantly fall in love with.

My favorite items are the tamales (pork)with the green sauce, gorditas (gf's favorite), nopales (that's cactus and any self respecting southwestern Mexican restaurant will serve these) and the Mexican sweet breads (not brains, yuck). The food comes fast and my orders have always been right. There is a salsa bar that's always stocked. It's a dine in or take out establishment with no servers.

The carnitas burro blew me away.  Fresh, homemade flour tortilla makes a huge difference.  Carnitas were incredibly moist and tasty. Fresh guacamole, great salsa.

This place was flippin' good! I mean, gosh darn! How the heck did they just do that? Each bite made whoopee to my taste buds and stayed around afterwards to cuddle! It's not everyday that I find a restaurant that I absolutely want to be a regular at, but La Tolteca is a restaurant that I can see myself having a healthy relationship with, and, if I'm lucky, possibly growing old with. I'm all for market-style restaurants, and La Tolteca seriously nailed it!

Okay, now that that's out of my system, here's what I tried: I tried the chips and salsas, huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles. The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal! Every single bite made me so happy, and even after everyone was full at the table, we still managed to pick away at it until it was completely consumed.

Try the bakery, there are many excellent pastries to try and the salsa bar has more variety than you can find at the more common walk up Mexican eateries.

Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but ""Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."" This place is amazing. 

One of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. 

We looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those).

Entertainment (besides the always interesting people watching) usually consists of some performance art, magic tricks, DJs spinning beats, and my favorite, a burlesque troupe (Provacatease). At times a little kooky, I always find it enjoyable and have a great time at these parties. The crowd is varied and full of fun weirdos. I love it! 

Besides the main events, Alwun House also hosts speakers, poetry and rotating exhibits. You can become a member for $25 a year, too, which helps support this local spot.",review,4,RxfFQxUtSIGYwTKU_rvAeg

People.  Just take a gander at the picture offered here on this page and tell me what would stop you from going there to eat an unbelievably delicious basket of fries and burger, each such perfectly seasoned to compliment one another, its as if this stuff was made from the craftsmanship of a gastronomic grill master.  The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.

The picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.

My only beef (Heh.

Solid yelp reviews sold me, and they did NOT disappoint.
They opened at 5:00, but I got off of class at about 4:15, so I went down there and hung around for a bit. After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards, but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly), I placed my order. I was the first customer, yay! Amazingly, the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly. In terms of ""disasters"" that's a pretty minimal one. I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together, as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hour.
I had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end).
Best burger I've had, I think ever. All the ingredients were high quality, very nice cheddar cheese, mushrooms cooked with port, and garlic aioli. And the bun. Oh damn, the bun. Feathery is the best adjective. No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain.
The red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty.
Both the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff. They seemed very happy with their choices.

They've got beer, wine, and hurricanes. Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch. I snuck a peek at the brunch menu, and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too. They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week gradually.

I've been to Welcome Diner three times in the past two weeks.  I've sampled the lemon ricotta pancakes, the Holy Puerco special and a breakfast biscuit sandwich.  All were delicious, but the Holy Puerco was amazing.  A cheesy grit cake smothered in the most delicious pork I've ever eaten, topped with an egg and house-made pork cracklings, served with flavorful, crunchy potatoes...

I love to sit at the counter.  The crowd is friendly and the WD team is personable and efficient.  There is also plenty of seating outside, as there are only 9 stools at the diner counter.  And since it's in my neighborhood, I can easily walk or bike there.

Food is locally sourced when possible.  I was there yesterday when the guy dropped off the duck eggs.  Most entrees are in the 8-10 dollar range.  They have beer, wine, and limited cocktails.  I highly recommend the Hurricane, with fresh-squeezed juices, light and dark rums, and pomegranate grenadine.  And the new management DOES take credit/debit cards with the square.  You can have your receipt sent to your email or phone number.  I mention this because I saw a couple order who'd never paid with the square before.

Beyond a fantastic, locally driven food concept, they also make one of the greatest cocktails I've ever enjoyed; the Hurricane.

Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.] 

The Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]  
They make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good) 

My favorites:
Anything with their fried chicken. 
Anything with their biscuits. 
Their french fries are  hand cut and fabulous. 
They smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board. 
Their burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy). 
Their salads are lovely and tasty.

Have you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.

My crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of ""flare"" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.

Now let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.

There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. 

The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. 

Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! 

Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!",review,4,vF4B6eFdoDmyV_l7MLHMzw

Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?

Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was ""Leave your inhibitions at the door"", Bandaids follows up with ""... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes.""  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.

So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at ""the talent"".

Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.

I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a ""whusssuuup"" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly ""Hi!"" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.

This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.

But wait.

On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about ""check out THIS fucking thing!"", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like ""Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?""  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, ""Oh.  Its nice.  I like it."" before shitting himself.

I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  

Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.",review,18,-F32Vl8Rk4dwsmk0f2wRIw

If you BYOC (bring yo own company, bitches!) it is awesome. In this case, I was the company for a totally non-trashy, very classy female friend of mine who was in the mood to slum it. She lives down the block an had been wanting to check the place out for a while, so after a few hours of daydrinking, we hit the spot. 

Wow.

Stretch marks. Lots of grinding and wandering hands. Tits everywhere... and shit, that's just the male patrons, holmes. I was wearing all black (as usual) and put on my sunglasses for the lulz now and then, and my exceptionally skinny and lovely companion was paying with a stack $1's that she won in a dice game the night before... so the ladies and waitress probably figured that she was a stripper (she's actually an RN in an ICU) and that I was her coke dealer, and the guys were jealous that I was hanging with a hot babe whom I didn't have to pay for attention. So I guess that made me by default the coolest motherfucker in the place. How could I not give it 5 stars after that?

In reality we had a sociological discussion about the patrons and employees, and discussed a few articles in the latest issue of the New Yorker, which she happened to have in her purse. 

Some of the characters we saw:

Saigon '68 - Old dude who only got dances from the asian girls, reliving the glory days in 'nam.

Hombre - in his sunday finest with cowboy hat and boots, looking very confused. He might have jumped the border last week.

PCC - White haired, super thin, wrinkly cracker who probably wandered in from the Phoenix Country Club across the street, in shorts, white polo, knee high white socks, and of course velcro sneakers. He looked reminiscent of a corpse.... except when he got several dances from well endowed black women, at which point he really became alive. 

Short Dick Man - He had clearly sprouted some wood, and it wasn't very impressive. 

Vatos - galore.

So - think dive bar that is totally ghetto fab. If you wait around long enough, they'll have 2 for 1 drink specials, though I am sure that the ""grey goose"" I ordered was some shitty well shit and not the goose. Whatever.

After reading other reviews of this place, I already had a feeling it was going to be good...but the Paradise Market...hmmm... Made me ask myself what my idea of a paradise market would be. ( In case you were wondering, it would include Gael Garcia Bernal, Alejandro Fernandez, Juanes and other latinos guapos pushing shopping carts... shirtless.)

Anyway...focus!...Walking in from the parking lot, I could already hear lively music spilling out of the store. My blood started to sizzle with excitement. Then, right after crossing the threshold, I beheld a thing of dazzling beauty- carts and carts of aromatic and fresh pan dulce. I knew this place and I were just beginning a long and promising relationship. 

My roommate and I wandered around the pan dulce display cases, salivating, pointing, giggling. We opted not to purchase as we have way too many holiday sweets left over as it is. We continued on to the jugeria where I had the best horchata I have had in a long, long time. Too much of the time horchata is watery. The Ranch Market horchata was so flavorful and creamy. I drank it just like a little kid who doesn't even let the straw leave their mouth for a moment. 

We then wandered throughout the whole store. I know I probably looked awe-struck because it is overwhelming. It is bustling and frenetic and packed full of food treats, smells, conversation...LIFE. Be sure to pass by the tortilleria and take in the smell of freshly cooked tortillas. Also, don't miss the meats! Chicken feet! Tongue!  Tripas! Oh yeah! AWESOME! 

Who the hell would ever want to go to a Safeway again when shopping can be this entertaining?

I'll be sure to go back soon for some pan dulce, a raspado or some lunch. More than anything, I'll go back for the experience because that's what this place is- a cultural experience.",review,2,e9T0tyMXRPDBIHE5BE35UA

This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.

Holy crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!

The food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. 

And the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.

Best of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice.",review,7,4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA

Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.

After having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.

Part grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.

But that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.

The place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)

Oh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.

I'm not familiar with the holiday, but it's the one where they bake tons of cakes with little babies in them..? Someone help me here. Back to the point, it was EXTREMELY festive, and I don't know if it was the heat, or that I was tired, or that the place was just so decked out in colors and people and decorations, but I got sick. Sick to where I had to wait outside by the car for my company. Hilarious. Needless to say I was a little frightened, so it took a little while for the curiosity to pique again. 

Second time was yesterday evening. Perhaps it was because instead of being a busy Saturday it was a slower (still busy, though) Tuesday that I was able to survive this visit. The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada? Or maybe the bakery for something sweet...? 

Found out the Horchata is way too sweet (but delicious) to drink alone so I shared with the boy. Grabbed some kind of sweet roll from the bakery that we practically fought over...and oh my! It was Taco Tuesday at the restaurant! I ordered 4 asada tacos for $2.99 and thanked the lord my boy is a vegetarian. Best carne asada ever! 

And the atmosphere in here is great. Oh! And they're open late. 6a-11p.

I usually make sure I go on Wednesdays where produce is ridiculously cheap...like 7 kiwi's for a dollar or 9lbs for a dollar watermelon...I'm not gonna lie, I have posted my receipts on the fridge with pride...these are my ""A"" graded school papers of adulthood. The only issue is that when I come home with a trunk full of fresh fruit and veggies that cost me $8 I slowly realize I have to actually store and eventually eat all of the produce I just bought. I hear Thursdays are the days to buy meat for cheap--but my fridge is usually busting with pineapple and strawberries by that point and there isn't room for an ounce of carne asada. 
long story short, be prepared to weave through the masses on Wednesday mornings for some great finds. The rest of the market is fabulous as well.

We started off with dinner in the cafe inside the market - just $5.99 for 3 street tacos, beans, and rice - and it totally filled me up. I washed it down with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle and it took me back to my childhood to the days before corn syrup became the norm. 

After eating, we took our time perusing the aisles and examining the foods foreign to us. They have a beautiful produce department and the prices were great on both the more exotic items like fresh papaya's to the staples like tomatoes and lettuce. 

The meat department is a carnivore's dream come true. Loads of fresh ground beef, pork, and poultry at very fair prices. I had to laugh at the ground pork in the glass case and wish I'd brought my camera. The butcher shaped it into a pig head - complete with a snout - and put cucumber slices for eyes. Not something I'd expect to see at my local gringo Fry's.

*The area to eat lunch was fun I enjoyed my street tacos and the al pastor tacos were amazing! Yummy plus very inexpensive seriously!
*The bakery well lets just say I just kept staring at it wishing I could have it but I splurged on the tacos and horchata! Though my daughter loved it! :)

The owner of Halo turned me on to this place a couple of weeks ago and I finally made my trip over. It's not your typical shopping experience, so if you are faint hearted, don't even attempt it during the warmer months!

This place wholesales to pet stores and service providers, but as they are a locally owned and family run establishment, they open up their warehouse to the general public. Basically, you get to go rummage around their warehouse, along with their workers who are pulling huge orders, and fill up your basket or cart with anything you can imagine that is pet related (except for food). I mean good lord, I didn't even know they made facial scrub products for dogs and had no clue that they had specialty shampoos for red heads, blondes, and brunettes!!!

But let's take a tour of my cart:
tennis ball squeaky bone - check
chicken jerky  - check
chicken rice balls - check
odor eliminator candles - check
happy bunny buffs - check (oh yeah these rock)
window kitty bed - check
case of greenie things - check
remote controlled citronella training collar - check
horribly embarrassing foo foo collar decoration - check

Here are few things you should know before you go:
1) There is a $25 minimum purchase (not sure if that is the same on line).
2) Every single one of their products is on their website or in their catalog and that is where you will find pricing info.
3) They have tiered pricing, so if you are buying one of an item, you will pay the highest amount. Each item has a ""bulk"" price which kicks in when you buy 3 to 12 of that item (depending on the product).
4) Prices ROCK, even the highest price is about 20% less than the big box pet stores and as much as 50% less than the boutiques. I went to look for a spray training collar (the non-shock kind) for my youngest dog and it was literally 60% less than the best price I could find anywhere else.
5) You have to put it together... if you are buying a crate or carrier, they will get it to your car, but  you have to assemble it yourself.
6) They have two full walls covered with clearance items that you will never see on line or in a catalogue.
7) This place is only open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but phone and web orders can be picked up until 5:00 p.m.
8) The warehouse is cooled by coolers and was hotter than a son of a bitch when I was there. Industrial fans be damned... nothing is going to make you cooler - but a deal is a deal. Go in the cooler months and stock up, or shop on line.  http://www.ryanspet.com/ryanspet/default.asp?

The staff is INCREDIBLY nice (especially considering that they must be rattled by the heat during the summer). As you are wandering the aisles, they make sure you know they are there to answer questions, pull box, help you find a specific item, etc.

They also have a sharpening service in their sister building, where you can get your shears spiffed up for a reasonable price.

Horse Dog goes though dog beds about every month or so, and he requires state-of-the-art industrial toys, as he can destroy anything (including tires, couch cushions or shoes) in a matter of seconds. 

Just when I thought that Horse Dog was also going to consume my wallet as a result of his high-priced needs, I drove by Ryan's Pet Supplies and decided to stop in. Wholesale? Pet Supplies? In a world of overpriced PETCOs and PetSmarts, this place is now my savior.

Since their warehouse is Home Depot sized, things were a little bit hard to find at first. I was overwhelmed by aisle after aisle of boxes stacked on shelves towering to the celling. Luckily the staff members here are incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and accessible. They were more than happy to guide me through the store, answer my questions and open / search through box after box until I found exactly what I wanted. 

Ultimately I decided to purchase a massive human femur sized dog bone for only $9, and a giant industrial rope knot for a mere $8. My jaw dropped when the casher rang me up for a whopping grand total of $17. I would have spent well over $50 had I purchased these two items elsewhere.  

And it gets even better. Ryan's also has a catalog, so I can call ahead and phone in my order. It's like take-out for dog supplies. Plus if they don't have what your looking for, they can get it for you within a weeks time so you don't have to waste a trip there. 

Also, as a note to the ladies (or men too if you've got your murse in tow), they don't allow purses or bags of any kind into the warehouse. I didn't know this the first time I walked in, so they flagged me down upon my entrance. They lock your purses up in little cages, or they say you can leave it in your car...but um hello...have you seen that area?! So it's perfectly safe under the watchful eye of the cashiers. And if you seriously think that these employees are going to steal something from your purse, that they lock in a cage, in area equipped with video cameras, then you are overly paranoid.

When I first got my four-legged BFF, I was given a tip that there was a place that had dog gear nearly thirty percent less than the typical stores.

The store is centrally located on McDowell Road, and while the area is not exactly DC Ranch, you are not in the ghetto, and you will be perfectly safe even if you don't own an AR-15.

It is really important to note that Ryan's is set up as an internet order place, NOT as a retail store. This explains why the business does a few things differently than regular retail. Purses/bags either need to be left in your car, or the store will lock them up in the front. I recommend you bring your purse/bag inside, the staff is cool, and they will lock it up for you. While this may be an inconvenience , the price difference will easily make up for any hiccups.

The second tip that will save you time/energy is to know what you wish to purchase, and know how much it will cost. As mentioned before, it is a warehouse, and items are not labeled with price, it's a huge warehouse setup. They have catalogs all over the place to check prices, but my recommendation is to bring your catalog with pages marked of the stuff you want. The staff is super friendly, and will help you with where things are at. It's not always easy to know who works there, but you will figure it out, they're usually pushing metal carts, basically fulfilling online orders by pulling merchandise from the bins.

While you're here, you will find toys, brushes, shampoos, snacks, you name it! The prices are very very good, and you will be happily surprised at the difference between the other guys and Ryan's. Don't miss the kong squeaky toy line, they have fun squeaky toys that are hard to break. Also, the fleecy rope toys are great for dogs teeth, and keep them fresh and so clean clean. Avoid any rope toys, they can break down and when dogs eat them, they can do big time damage to stomach, GI etc.

We recently showed our home for the first time on a historic home tour.

We went to Red hoping just to find some inspiration, but after explaining to the owner what we were doing, he offered to send someone to review our space.

We ended up with a suede 60's era danish couch and two leather chairs that made the rest of our interior look downright stupid. We ended up redecorating, paint and all, to better suit the new furniture. It was a lot of work but well worth it.

If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.

Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. 

For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. 

The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.

I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too.

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties.

What great way to detox your body and find all the muscles and balance points you rarely use (you'll find them the hard way, BTW, but that's another story).
As I was lying on the mat at the end of the class, listening to Max (our instructor/Chief Yogi), telling us to just be and to try to not think...try not to eat or drink for an hour after the session and just let our bodies detox, all I could think of was ""what can I eat to retox as quickly as possible, that won't kill me where I stand?""
Not an easy question to ponder, even with the existential power of yoga still pulsating through every fiber of my being...a chili dog from Ted's or Long Wong's?; an Italian Beef  from Luke's; Chicken and waffles from Lolo's?
And then it hit me, almost causing me to stir from my yoga induced coma, Taco's de Juarez!!!!!
As anyone who has read even one of my reviews will tell you, I am a ""Trendinista"" of the first order. 
I follow the herd, make no mistake about it! 
Why?
Because, occasionally, the herd knows where it's going...and this is one of those very special occasions!
I had spotted this place before...on my way by at high speed, to get to Welcome Diner for a burger.
But since I wasn't packing, I never, ever stopped rolling, let alone got out of my car here. 
Yelp changed all that. This place has some terrific reviews, in spite of the fact that there isn't a Betos or Bertos in sight. 
Worth a try, right?
Taco's of Juarez is a delightfully dirty little gem...the proverbial diamond in a goat's ass. 
I sat down and the sweet little non-english speaking waitress brought chips and salsa...The Two Grinders (Los Dos Molino's) need to take salsa lessons from these folks...some of the best salsa I have had (the salsa verde is definitely the best I've had in the US...makes me long for couple of places along the beach in Bahia de Navidad).
In an effort to retox as quickly as possible, I ordered the number 16 lunch especial...a shredded beef gordita (""gordita"" means ""meat wrapped in lard, then deep-fried"" in Spanish) and a cerveza (ice, ice cold BTW).
Freakishly good...I know, it was almost pure lard that had been heated to point where it lost its molecular cohesion and liquefied...but it was damn tasty lard. I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in.
I awoke to shouts of ""clear"" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding! 
I am fine:) !!
So, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco's of Juarez. Possibly the best Mexican food in town!

i overheard him mention his ""other restaurant"" so on our way out i asked him about it. he was also super friendly with me and filled me in on Circa 1900 (which I've also heard lots of good stuff about). i will be heading there on my next dining adventure.

Sadly, I was apparently not on a date and ended up having to pay for our bill BUT in retrospect I was still so damn impressed by this place.

Rumor has it that this place is owned by several male flight attendants and when they're not attending flights they are running this restaurant. Leave it to world travelers to produce a classy but quaint but sosticated but understated establishment that can truly please everyone. In true Phoenix fashion, Coronado Cafe was once a house and now stands as a Bistro Cafe. The front porch is now patio seating with cute little tables and bench style sitting all under canopy drapes and string lights. On the inside is the cutest little bar area, very small, but the older gentlemen running the place is so cute and you can tell he really know is cocktails and puts passion into crafting each one. There's also a secluded side patio that's ADORABLE.

We ate inside the dining room because the rain (rain, I know... in Phoenix?) started coming down and the wait staff was so attentive and helped us relocate. We were sat in the corner by a window that had its own little garden bed outside. Could not get over this palces cute factor. Tables were small but candle lit and had the presh checker print table clothes, real napkins and honestly one of the best waitresses I've ever had. 

We order 2 Tequilatinis on Happy Hour and the artichoke dip. This artichoke dip opened the gates of heaven and brought to us the most delightful, out of the ordinary, festive taste I have ever had. It was spicy, but cheesy. It was melty but had good size chunks of artichoke. Simply, cannot go on enough about how good it was.

I cannot wait to go back here and have brunch or enjoy the sunset with drinks on the patio.

Our great experience started from the second we turned onto the property. A friendly man told us were to park. We entered and were greeted by a smile. We were seated quickly. We let JR, our fantastic server, know that we were on our way to a show and were limited on time. He then made suggestions as to what entrees would be best. I ordered the crab cakes, which are by far the best I have ever had in the valley! They were all crab and no filler. I laughed at my husband for ordering the meatloaf, although JR said that it is really good. To my surprise, that even came out looking and smelling fantastic. My husband truly enjoyed every single bite. 
It's far too often that one spends too much money on a dinning experience that's not enjoyed.

Look out for Triple J! Jillian, Janel, & JR always take great care of me!! They all have great attitudes, very personable, and know the menu very well. 
You can't go wrong with the crab cakes!! Or the miso salmon, mmmm!! Any seafood really. I've complained about my salmon not being cooked properly at other restaurants but that is not an issue here!!
I also love the Gorgonzola salad, chicken Caesar wrap, and meatloaf!!!

As others have mentioned, it's a great date place whether your date is a spouse, friend, or family member. I noticed a lot of people come in before a play- perfect ambiance for a romantic evening.

Get a sitter for the kids- I would give you a Samantha Jones style stare down if you brought in loud grubby children who would definitely ruin my dinner in a cozy place like this. ( I am a nanny who loves children as well as dining out with children. But I also believe in adults having their happy place considering I don't go to the playground with cigarettes & beer to be in the way of 12 & under spring break! Thanks.)

Parking lot works, location is great- super close to I-10, but far enough away to not have the noise while on the patio. Sometimes I come in just for a beer since I am in the neighborhood a lot and just melt into that patio. I'll be back soon! (Maybe tonight!)

Start with atmosphere as there is absolutely no way to ignore it.  In a mad jumble of antiquities ranging from the 20's to the 70's every item is either a conversation piece, memory or a must have.  I bought a mod 60's chappeau my baby brother picked out as being ""me"" and I am eyeing a full bonnet hair dryer the size of a rice cooker :p

Onto the soda fountain.  There are egg creams, hot fudge and a toe curling number of flavor possibilities. I always want to cook up something outrageous to try but seem to drift toward their amazing executions of classic favorites.

The regular menu is exactly as it should be.  I have yet to be bold enough to try their Hawiian cole slaw (so 50's) but all of their soups, sides, etc. taste home made with reasonable prices.  I was reading through the reviews here and saw a couple mentions of split pea soup ... how is it I've never been when they've had it?!?!  I am now on a mission to go when it is being served.

On a side note, MacAlpine's serves stuffed tomotoes!  Your choice of tune or chicken salad, I imagine they'd do egg if you asked over greens and surrounded by lots of veggies, etc.  It's the kind of dish to inhale after killing yourself at the gym and you won't feel all that bad about it.

P.S. Sometimes the service can seem a bit oddly timed but when you take into account the division of labor and the nature of the place it does make sense.

They have a list of over 50 types of sodas/egg creams, milkshakes. I was in love. I ordered a nectar egg cream and it was to . die. for.

I grew up eating Mexican food (my dad is Mexican) and this is real Mexican food, no doubt about it. Rito's has been in the same location on 14th street for a long long time... I think around 30 years. There isn't a sign outside...you just have to know it's there.  Just look for the people walking out with smiles on their faces and to go containers in their hands.

When I was there for lunch it was filled with city workers, parents with young kids, and retiree's who live in the neighborhood.  Rito's is family owned, and honestly, I think grandma does the cooking. Also, it's cash only. 

You pretty much have to know what you want when you get to the order window because the place is packed and they don't have time to answer your questions about what's in this and what's in that. 

After asking the other patrons in line what's the best,  they pretty much all said the same thing...Green Chili Burro...I think it was less than five bucks. I also ordered the beans and rice. My husband ordered the same thing. There was so much food that we could have easily shared one with all the extras...I guess we figured since it was so cheap it's be small...no way...HUMONGOUS!  

We took it to go and ate it in the car...cheese, beans and rice were flying every where, the windows were steamed up...the car was rockin' cause we were soooo happy...I'm sure passers by thought something kinky was goin' on inside our car. Nope...just chowin' down on some damn good Mexican food. 

I hope I haven't given it away and blown the secret of Rito's by Yelping it...I love the fact that there isn't a sign, you have to know about it to know that it is even exists and it's a locals only kinda place.

For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.

First of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.

Tortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.

I love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.  

I think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.

So they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.

As far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables. 

They are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think. 

They're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.

I think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.

DEEEEE-LICIOUS chimichangas and the best green chile this side of any freaking river. Occasionally they will have a daily special, but most days it's just the 6 to 8 things they have to chose from on their little menu board. They don't advertise it, but they will make cheese crisps for your little ones. My daughter still hasn't gotten into eating beans or spicy chicken or beef, and a couple of times they made her a quesadilla.

Don't be put off by the super huge line of people coming out the door, you will want to wait for this food. Make sure you have the time to find parking and wait. The reward is worth it.
It's cash only and they close a little after lunch time. They have canned sodas for you to sip on and a small patio around the corner for you to sit and enjoy your food.

I picked up a chunk of smoked bacan that they slice for you and the smoked pork butt is just wow! I went home and chopped some up and sauteed it with some sliced fennel bulb and lentils and it was like wow, so good, both smoky and salty. I also picked up some sort of dried sausage stick and though it is bad for you, it is so good - a great addition to a nice glass of red wine, some cheese, and some good french bread.

I found out about it from a Polish man who was searching for ingredients to make Polish moonshine. We were discussing the paucity of delicatessens here in the desert (a theme that transits my reviews) and he mentioned that this place was everything you wanted out of a deli. He was correct.

Much like the best delicatessens, the food is ethnic. Eastern European sausage is their specialty. You can get other stuff, and it is also good. However their selection of handmade Eastern European sausage is absolutely phenomenal. 

The woman behind the counter is also terrific! You get the sense that she would rap you on the head with a spoon if she could get away with it. My first time in, I was reading the menu, she walked up and asked, ""What you want?"" in a heavy (likely Polish) accent. When I hesitated, she exclaimed, ""C'mon, what are you hungry for?"" Don't let the gruffness fool you, she is only bringing home the point that we spend too much time at places like Subway ordering their ""meals"" than thinking about what we'd like to eat.

I go two hot dogs that first time, they were absolutely amazing. I mean they were hot dogs, just amazing hot dogs. Since then I have also tried the polish sausage, a turkey sandwich (just a bite) and the pierogies...OMG the pierogies! 

--why is it that any place that makes pierogies only sells them by the dozen? they are soooo heavy!!!--

The roast beef has a nice beef flavor, the ham is a nice combination of smokey and salty and the turkey is sweet and jusy. The veggies are fresh and crisp.

We were first given a bowl of chips and salsa.  The salsa looked like a mix between red and green salsa, and since I have a weird aversion to green salsa, I hesitantly tried it.  It was delicious, as were the house-made chips.  We ate two bowls immediately because we couldn't stop.

After asking the waitress what was best, my fiance decided on the spicy marinated fish, and I on the garlic shrimp.  Holy crap, it was delicious.  The garlic sauce for my shrimp covered everything, from the beans and rice to the secret fries beneath the shrimp (which magically didn't get soggy).  My fiance said his fish was the best he's ever had in America.  Mine also came with tortillas (I chose flour), and they were great, like the kind my mom bought from the ""tortilla lady"" back home.

We were so full we couldn't move afterward, but I woke up in the morning craving the garlic sauce again...

The place is small and quaintly decorated, like something you might find in a small town.  We saw lots of families and tables of friends come and go.  The best part is, you don't have to sit and awkwardly wait for your check.  You check out at the desk.

We decided on this place after my son did a little research on Mariscos Restaurants in the area. It was in celebration of my hubs ""26th"" birthday and his craving for Mariscos. 

Upon pulling up to the restaurant we gave each other questionable look due  to the size of the restaurant and neighborhood, but it quickly discipitated upon entrance. Beautifuuul, colorful decor. Very clean and plenty of seating with a full bar. We chose seats and our waitress came over for our drink order. In addition to the traditional chips and salsa we were also brought ceviche tostadas..

I ordered the fish tacos - FABULOUS. I was expecting fried fish and cream sauce but received fresh grilled fish with a sprinkling of cheese. I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food. The rice is not a tomato based rice, flavorful nonetheless, white with veggies. Very good. The beans were also very good, reminded me of grandmas.

Do not even look at the menu, people. Just order a Dos Equis and the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. 

My boyfriend and I found this place on the Yelp app, like most eateries we visited while in Phoenix. I cannot express how happy this place made us. We loved the restaurant, the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport.

The Molcajete Caliente is $22 for two people. You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas. But the main event... a volcanic-like cast iron cauldron (a molcajete) teeming with bubbling green sauce with various kinds of grilled meats and seafood hanging around the outside. The smell alone will bring you halfway to heaven, but ZOMG, taste explosion! SO GOOD. 

It comes with two breaded fish filets, two pieces of grilled steak, two of chicken and four big shrimp. Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten. 

The service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually. The prices are almost unbelievable ($22 for a VOLCANO OF FOOD??). 

The restaurant itself is really clean and full ceramic tiles and colorful artwork. Some reviewers have commented about the dodgy location. The neighborhood seemed fine to me, though I don't live in Phoenix so I could be mistaken. It's mostly residential, but well-worth making a special trip (like, every single day) for this food!

Note: If you're planning on ordering the ceviche as an appetizer, just be aware that you might not get your house ceviche tostadas.

However, my aunt and I read some reviews and used our best cajoling to get her out of her mu mu and into the car to visit this little restaurant just down the way from Ranch Market. 

When we walked in, I was excited by the colors and festive feel that they have. We were greeted by the owner who is very attentive, and seated straight away. Having read the Yelp! reviews, I knew I was going to aim for the camarones culichi, and gazed at their vast options anyhow. I consider myself pretty seafood savvy! They have such an array of fish dishes that I long to try! Especially their fish soup... it looked amazing. However, I stuck to my trusted reviews and ordered the camarones culichi, my mother ordered the garlic shrimp, and my aunt ordered the fried fish filet. 

I know they said not to fill up on the chips and salsa-- but that green salsa made me so happy, I think I will order a pint to take home next time I go. Trust me. 

First, they brought by little ceviche tostadas to try-- I was so excited that the fish tasted so fresh and delightful. Also, free ceviche? I have no idea if they do this all the time, but what a deal! It had a chipotle and citrus flavor immersed in it and was light, but very satisfying. 

The culichi sauce is full of tomatillo, cilantro, garlic, and lime-- however, their combination is so magical, I cannot express it without salivating. The shrimp are cooked in the sauce and brought out separate from the salad, beans, and rice, and they have the same amazing taste. I will seriously write a poem for how that sauce tastes-- and they give you plenty of fresh tortillas that I wrapped the beans and rice with and dipped in that sauce to ensure I got every last drop. You could taste the freshness of the fish even in the fried fish, which was seasoned and fried to perfection. The ""exquisite salad"" that they offer with every meal really is exquisite, while simple and melds to the meals well since there isn't a strong dressing on it. 

The point is, we left so amazingly joyful and thanked the owner about ten times. I don't know how I am expected to go to another restaurant for some time...",review,5,sWtIduPNp6MtUPrGnDcb8Q

Playa Hermosa has never disappointed me.  There quality is very consistent and I would be soooo sad if they ever stop their business.  Let me give them 10 stars out of 5.  They are that good!

Please don't be discouraged because of the area it's in.  I know some people would never come to this part of town...they are missing out!  

I love walking into the restaurant to their colorful decors.  Once you are seated, you will get a generous portion of freshly made warm tortilla chips with a red and a green salsa, no questions asked.  They don't care if you're going to order later on...here, have some chips and salsa!  They have a full bar and a TV with sports playing all the time.  Now you can have some drinks with free chips and salsa while watching a game.  Once you order, they will bring you a tostada with ceviche.  It's on the house.  Their ceviche is fresh and flavorful without being overpowered by excessive lime.

As for entrees, I would recommend....
- shrimp culichi
- fish tacos
- grilled shrimp
- fried fish in garlic sauce
- molcajete
- any types of ceviche

Restaurant and Food:  The restaurant is nice and cozy.  At max, there are maybe 15 tables in the entire joint.  However, don't let the size, location, and lack of flashy chain-like display fool you.  The menu has a wide array of choices from fish tacos to different styled fish plates.  I had a fish plate prepared with garlic and a lemon pepper seasoning (Pescado Ajo Mojo I think) as well as an horchata for my beverages.  The food was impeccable!  In my experience, coming across fresh seafood in Phoenix is hard.  The seafood was well prepared and fresh (no gamy-fishy taste).   Additionally, the menu has pictures of almost every dish so you can gauge your interest in a choice (Visual examples appeal to me).

Service:  Spot on along with the food!  As mentioned previously, the restaurant is not that big.  Our server was always on top of her game and frequently stopped in to check on us.  

Atmosphere:  The restaurant has a bright decor that is very fun and fitting for the type of restaurant.  Not to sound cliche, but you will feel almost as if you are at mom's kitchen (I'm Hispanic and my parent's house has similar decor).

The food was excellent. Shrimp ceviche -- incredible. The waitress recommended molcajete caliente (cheesy hotpot with fish, shrimp, chicken, carne asada, and octopus).

The chips are fresh-made flour rather than corn (I am usually more of a corn tortilla person, but these are delicious).  The salsa is a green chili salsa that leaves a slow burn in your mouth that makes it hard to quit eating.

I have been here twice now.  The first time I ordered cheese enchiladas, which were good.  I noticed they had potato flautas on the second visit.  I used to love flautas when I ate meat and missed them when I went veg years ago.  I was stoked to finally find a place that served flautas stuffed with something other than meat.  They were good and topped with a very tasty guacamole. (I am sure that the meat ones are equally good if not better)  I look forward to trying the torta on the next visit.  (I returned for the torta a few days later and it is excellent as well.)

I am happy to have stumbled onto this place.  There are a number of small Mexican restaurants on this stretch of McDowell and I have been wanting to try some of them for awhile.  La Hacienda is right on the corner of 16th and McDowell. It has a unassuming appearance on the outside, other than its windows splashed with daily specials.  The interior is pretty cool though.

Gardening help, botanical research & education, workshops, event facilities, taste of the desert tours, Monarch Butterfly exhibit, garden tours, special music, art and romantic evening events, children's events. So much to do & see, so little time . . . . . even a man will love it here!

I even lost track of time while I learned about how much water a Saguaro can hold and doing my best to detect the animals that inhabit the gardens. I spotted jackrabbits and many birds (including quail, and hummingbirds)!

One of my favorite paths told me the stories of the people that have survived off the desert lands for the past decades of years! It explained how they would survive with the resources at hand and gave hands on examples of little projects that kids/adults alike would be very interested in doing. This particular path also gave the descriptions of what various plants/trees/cacti are used for currently (i.e. building, fuel, food, medicinal, etc.).

There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.

There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time.

The Chihuly exhibit was amazing, well worth the need to reserve tickets.  If you haven't seen it, you should really check it out.  The photos I took don't do justice to seeing it live, and in such an incredible setting.

The gardens would have been fabulous, but the Chihuly installion delivered icing to a tasty cake.  For fifteen bucks, it was one of the nicest walks I have taken in a long time.

On my sixth day in Phoenix, I decided to take a few hours from my hectic schedule of class during the day, getting lost on the way back to the hotel and working into the wee hours and see something of my weeklong adopted city.  Perusing those magazines left in the hotel room by the management (in a vain attempt to say, ""Get of the room, sometimes, dearies, you work too hard!"")  I found an ad for the Chihuly exhibit, went online to buy a ticket and had my plans _made_.  I would have gone to the zoo, but it closes at five _everyday_.  The garden is open until nine, which gave me time to leave class, get lost driving there and still have some wandering around inside the garden time.

Ok, the temperature was 103 that day, so even in the early evening, it was pretty hot, but I  took water and there were fountains dispersed throughout the park.  Even iin the gloaming, I got a little sun, but I would definitely advise the strongest sunblock you can find.  

They were having an evening event with jazz and food and drinks, but as the park filled up with people, it didn't seem appreciatively more crowded, except in the food and drink areas.  This park is large enough to accommodate lots and lots of people. 

Just a note of the Chihuly glass.  This is a major installation.  I lost count as to how many pieces were here.  My brother wrote in my blog that this was where Chihuly pieces belonged, not indoors, in museums.  I respectfully disagrees, I love to see Chihuly pieces anywhere.  Surroundings do interact with his art, but wherever I see his work, it changes and grows.  Just as limiting Goldworthy's work to outdoors would only show us one side of that talented artist, limiting Chihuly's work to outdoor installations, would only show us a limited number of facets of his work. 

Ok, I'll get off my soapbox now.  :::griN:::

The new cactus garden is spectacular; I love standing in the herb garden and taking deep breaths. My favorite trail is the Sonoran Desert Trail because it has some of the best views of the east valley and Papago Park.

Unfortunately, Phoenix didn't have an array of free places to visit, besides walking around downtown or their version of Old Town. Being from San Diego, I got spoiled by being able to walk around the beaches, Balboa Park, Seaport Village, the Gaslamp District.... You get the picture.

Though the Desert Botanical Garden isn't free ($15 per adult), I gotta say that this has to be on everyone's to visit list, if one ever goes to Phoenix. The desert garden is pretty amazing, with all it's wild life and vegetation. Walking around the garden paths, we spotted lizards, cacti and birds galore! I even saw a garden gnome (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IdCOpMsZ67g-oQZLgAsnOA?select=-TOj_E-xHmaOBW9NggUMmg). No joke!

Coincidentally, the DBG happened to be hosting the Chihuly Glass exhibit, while we visited. So, we got more bang for our buck. For an additional $3, we also got to see the Butterfly Exihibit.

It's been a while since I could say I was ""enchanted"" by anything...I was enchanted by las noches de las luminarias at Desert Botanical Garden:-)

The Beautiful Carin and I had not been to las noches de las luminarias (""lndll"":) before...in fact, when she told me we were going, I think I said something to the effect ""it's just another way to separate us from our money at Christmas time...Bah...Humbug!!!"" :-)

Carin said something like ""lighten up Ebenezer"", and off we went:)

Well, lndll does separate you from a little cash to get in and a little more to have a toddy or three by the fire...but it's money well spent...maybe even money well invested:)

We got into the garden shortly after sunset and I have to say, I was awed from start to finish!

As we walked in, we were greeted with spectacularly lit Chihuly Glass cacti, along with hundreds of luminarias lighting our path...the soft sounds of a mariachi band playing just inside the entrance, adding a distinct Sonoran feel to the experience:)

Once inside we wandered around and just simply enjoyed all that was happening and all that we were seeing...around one corner, the path led through a small stand of dimly lit Pipe Organ Cacti...around another bend, a bluegrass band playing from a perch nestled between giant boulders...over there, a children's handbell choir playing holiday favorites...always with the silhouette of Papago in the background and luminarias and well placed decorative holiday lighting in the plants to guide us:)

No one seemed to be in a hurry...no one pushed or raced along the paths...everyone smiled and chatted with each other...we had a number of brief, cheery conversations with people that we had never seen before and will never see again...we helped a couple of snowbirds that had a stuck wheelchair (I helped with a song in my heart and smile on my face..not like me at all...my heart must be growing 3 sizes! :-)...here, during lndll, it was just what you do!

As the evening grew a little late and some of the luminarias began to flicker and die, we found a spot next to the fire in the Berlin Agave Yucca Forest and had a couple of Steaming Hot Martini's (I have no idea what was in them, except liquor...but they were tasty and warming and they made us happy:)

We sat there for a while and talked as we watched the fire, the flickering luminarias and the dwindling crowds...and I came to the conclusion that this might have been one of the best Christmas investments ever.

I hope you'll go and invest in Desert Botanical Garden, lndll and yourself...it's more than worth the price of admission:)

The Gardens are a mix of several different trails, each with a different theme: these range from a trail based on lifestyles of the ancient Sonoran Desert dwellers to a path based on desert wildflowers. Each path is a mixture of different desert plants mixed with educational exhibits. Highlighting the flowers are various sun-seared rock formations and distant mountains.

It's a very easy trail which is well marked; you won't get lost in the desert. A visit around sunset is also worth considering: the mix of light and shadows adds an extra dimension to the surroundings. The outer trails do close after sunset, although the inner path (The Desert Discovery Loop Trail) is lighted and remains open.

Other reviewers have offered good observations and tips so there is not much additive we can post here except for, perhaps, this tip.

Also great that it accomodates people of all ages and physical abilities on the easy to access pathways.

2. The Fall concert series. The Garden brings in great musicians at night under the stars in the cool Phoenix air. Enjoy a bottle of wine, Spanish guitar and nibble on the catered Arcadia Farms. We have so much fun at these events and try to make as many as we can.

3. Dia de los muertos. Another great event held at the Gardens. We had a blast as the Gardens goes all out celebrating the day of the dead. Amazing food, local artist, theater and the final procession.

4. Chocolate and Chili Festival. Yes, they go great together. Tons of Chocolatiers and music. A must for any chocolate lover.

1. They open at 7AM.  This means that you can go early and see the blossoms first thing in the morning.

2. As you walk in, head to the Desert Wildflower Loop Trail on the far right.  The hummingbirds and butterflys are most active first thing in the morning.

3. The latest Chihuly exhibits are best seen at night.  Absolutely stunning.

4. Regarding the price, just buy an annual pass.  Then you can come whenever you want and see the plants change with the seasons.

5. This place is extremely large and cell signals are spotty. They have free wifi in some key locations.  This is really nice for uploading photos.

Came with the family and used a Groupon thingamajig. Daughter is a coupon clipper and did a great job on this one. We could not decide whether to see the Chihuly exhibit at night or first thing in the morning. Granddaughter was with us so we decided to go with the early morning adventure and we were not disappointed.

Wow is all we can say. What an amazing selection of cactus, desert trees and bushes from all over the world. There are even wildflowers and tons of different critters and birds that make themselves right at home. It was fun watching everyone shooting pictures of just about anything that moved or sweet family photos next to something extravagant or amazing.

This is always been a great place to take people from out of town or just a great way to get some exercise while enjoying the heavenly works sent from above. We probably walked close to a couple of miles before we were done.

Bring your sunscreen, shady hat, some good walking shoes and plenty of liquids to drink. The dessert can take the life right out of you if you are not careful. So be cool and stay hydrated and rest in the shade when you get a chance. MOST EXCELLENT!

You get to witness various wildlife, from birds, rodents and lizards and is flat out a great experience. You automatically feel transported into a different world, so major props to the Desert Botanical Gardens and all who contribute to provide a place to showcase it all.

My partner in crime was kind enough to accompany me and as soon as we did we too joined the pupusa bandwagon, mmm pupusa bandwagon (drools). We had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa. I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get, but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger.

The appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref. pupusa). They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items, yum.

My gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it, I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak, which was good, but paled in comparison to the chicken.

Sidenotes: Try the ensalada drink, it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple. Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop, which as far as I'm concerned is off the proverbial chain. Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in.

After a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings, me and my beyonce decided to try Indian Delhi Palace, which is an excellent example of the latter.

The waiters were attentive without  being overbearing, and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy, slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy.  And the samosas we started off with were also great.  Not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of Indian places.

The palak paneer is wonderful!  Ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods.  The creamy spinach flavor doesn't become overbearingly hot, but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan, served fresh, of the soft and chewy variety that I prefer.

RE: The people who miss paneer... The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  Anyway, if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food, you might want to mention as such to your server.

Getting the food was one of my responsibilities and I had considered deli trays and had also looked at a few other catering places on line. All I knew is that I'd sooner die than call Fazoli's (who has often catered this lunch before). So it struck me suddenly with about a week to go- Red Devil! It's Italian, so it fits the theme, and we have always had a good meal there when we've gone. 

I stopped in to see the GM, Doug, and he took my order, assuring me that the portions listed for the hotel pan sizes I was getting are generous- I was feeding teenagers, after all, so I had my concerns. I was relieved that they could easily and pleasantly take my order so late in the game. They dropped off the food at our location on time, hot and fresh, and they even brought the napkins, plates, and plastic-ware. 

The food was a HUGE hit with everyone. The first pan to be emptied was the meat lasagna, followed by the chicken lasagna, and then the veggie penne pastas, one with chicken. The rolls were fantastic, and they even gave us plenty of real butter. Even the salads were by far a bigger hit with the kids than I had expected. And Doug was right- there was plenty of food and lots of people went back for seconds.

Best of all, when I gave the receipt to the treasurer of the organization, she was shocked at how low the price was, since last year, Fazoli's had cost close to twice as much! There is absolutely no comparison between the two when it comes to quality.

I would heartily recommend Red Devil for your catering needs- as well as for dinner.

If you're looking for awesome wings and very good pizza, Red Devil is the place to go. I'm not too sure if this is the original Red Devil, but it's very vintage. You gotta try their special that they have which is the 20 wings with a large pizza for like $25 bucks, I believe? Can't get any better than that. Their BBQ sauced wings are amazing on a dish. They're known for their perfect ranch sauce and fresh dinner rolls. I'm not big on hot wings, but my dad devours their hot wings every time we go, so they much be good!

About the Condos: 
- Both one or two bedroom condos are very spacious
- Very large balconies
- Outdoor storage space on the balcony
- Built in bookshelves
- Large windows for lots of natural light
- Tall ceilings
- Large tub/ shower- perfect for relaxing bubble baths
- 3rd floor condos have a wood burning fireplace
- Nice large tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms
- large dogs and other animals are allowed
- gated complex
- pool and hot tub
- work out facility 
- covered parking spot and some garages available for extra $

Overall the condos are wonderful! Most condos have been upgraded with granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathroom.  Also, most of the appliances have been updated to stainless steel.  In addition to the tiles in the kitchen and bathroom, most condos have either carpet or have been upgraded to wood flooring.  In all honesty when I was first looking at these condos they are similar to the neighboring complex, Red Rox.  However, Riverwalk has larger balconies and their exterior is painted a nice neutral white and tan, compared to Red Rox, which is a red and green color and always reminds me of christmas.      

In addition to the condos, I feel the location of these condos is fabulous! Located right on the border of Tempe and Phoenix; and Scottsdale is less than 5 minutes away.  Papago Park is right across the street for nice scenery, hiking and biking.  The Oakland A's baseball stadium is in walking distance for Spring Training games.  Also, the Phoenix Zoo is about a block away, next to the Botanical Gardens.  Right down the road is the Marquee Theater, the light rail, and Mill Ave.  Very easy to get anywhere you want to go from these condos!",review,5,J9wVWg6HZ8hDA8L3v3EAcA

What you need to know about the zoo.  
 - Wear comfortable shoes!  Like the rest of Phoenix, our zoo sprawls.
 - Wear sunscreen.  Most folks don't think about it, but I know lots of folks who have come away from there pink.
 - Try to avoid going in the midst of the summer.  Not only is it too hot for you, it might also be too hot for the animals and they'll be camped out in the back under some shade.  
 - The monkeys are awesome, as always, but they have a great area.
 - They have a really diverse group of animals in a diverse setting - from visiting the croc swamp to barren desert prairies.
 - The food isn't half bad!  We were surprised!
 - Zoo Lights!  Starting around Thanksgiving and going through January they light up much of the zoo with cool themed displays.  It's not the entire zoo, so less of a walk, but enough of one that it's worth the price of admission.
 - It's conveniently close to the Desert Botanical Gardens if you want to make your trip a 2-fer.
 - 2 Words - PETTING ZOO!  If you have kids - this is the place to go.  If you're bringing a date - SO the place to go.",review,1,l53FUDHRHLg7BQ89KgAtxQ

I *heart* the Phoenix Zoo.  I volunteered here while in high school.  I went on an awesome tour with the zoo's veterinarian when I thought I wanted her job (I learned that I prefer just loving my dog and visiting zoos).  The people who work here are amazing and love sharing knowledge about the animals.
I live in Chicago now, and though LP Zoo is pretty cool, I much prefer the Phoenix Zoo.  The animal habitats are bigger - so you don't always see as many animals, but I like knowing that the critters are running about and are not cramped into little cages.  The Phx Zoo offers so many educational opportunities for kids (the summer camp is great!!!) and fun events for adults, too.  If you really like the zoo, check into getting a membership, you help out animals and get to skip the lines for buying tickets!
Definitely follow Kristin C's advice and wear comfy shoes, sunscreen, and drink lots of water - the zoo is huge and you will be walking quite a bit.

fun  family music.   They have only one more Friday left this summer, so come out and have fun. There was a lovely breeze by about 7:00  and the sun  stopped heating it up. 

Always love the zoo, they seem to be getting more and more exhibits and animals.  I recommend going at the beginning of the day or end of the day. That's when many animals come out to play , feed and  water. 
Last  night we  saw the family of wild dogs playing and hanging out  also saw the cheetahs which was  a treat , they usually hide to camouflage .

The zoo is equipped with clean bathrooms, lots of places  for breaks and hanging out. We have had two birthday parties there and the kids loved it. 

The kids wanted a ride on the tram which was nice in the evening , we learned new facts from the guide and a little about the Zoo's work on keeping many animals from becoming extinct.

My 9 year old and my best friends 10 year old have been coming here since they were 2 and 3 . They love coming here and never seem to tire of it

Before we went there, we stopped at our favorite taco place, Guedos, and with bellies full we set off.

It's been a long time since I've gone to the zoo.  Probably because my life is like a zoo, I really don't want to go there to visit!  I think the last zoo I visited was the San Diego Zoo about 5 years ago.

We had a fabulous time.  The animals were out, we got to walk around in the beautiful natural setting, and enjoy each other's company.  My favorite animals were the meerkats and the elephants.  They had elephants there that are older than I am!  No wonder they have so many wrinkles!

We spent about 4 hours there and had a fabulous time.  We thought it was worth the $14 we paid per person to get in.  

I do agree with previous reviews.  We didn't buy food there, as there was no way I was going to pay big bucks for typical zoo food that isn't really good for you anyway.  We did pay $2.50 a bottle for water and soda.   Best thing for a family is to bring your own.

Favorite actvities at the zoo include: the monkey walk (there is no wall seperating you from the monkeys and they jump around the walking path - so fun!), the many kid parks/fountains to play in, the kids petting zoo, and the old giant turtles. 

Also, try out Zoo Lights! You can't use your membership to get it, but it's well worth the extra expense. We went in early July - dress your kids in bathing suits and bring tons of water! There are water activities everywhere, and the paths are lit up with magical lights.

Every person's inner child/geek is awakened when the opportunity presents itself to inform the rest of the party everything he or she knows about the komodo dragon, or the lion, or tigers, or elephants.  I know that I am instantly transformed into an obnoxious know-it-all docent recalling even the most minute detail from the safari cards I used to collect as a kid.  There is certainly a time and place for geeking out and my favorite time is zoo time!  I honestly think I missed my calling as a zoologist, and you may feel the same way if you were as book smart as I was in the fifth grade about animals.  I suspect every kid dreams of a lifetime tending to animals when they visit a zoo.

All that said, you will have a great time at this zoo.  It's arranged in a couple of concentric circles so if you give yourself an entire day to see it you can certainly make it all the way around, or at least you can see most of it like we did.  The animals here all seem well cared for and don't seem to mind their enclosures.  While not ideal, I did notice they have a good deal of space to roam with the exception of the warthog who was a heck of a lot more active than I had ever imagined.  You will notice that there are fully horned longhorn steer in the same pen as the giraffes.  At first, I thought they had to be some kind of import, but no, just regular longhorns.  Just when I thought to myself, ""how boring and odd,"" they erupted in a battle of horn locking and butting.  I'm a native Texan and I felt proud watching them mix it up like that.  Then I thought, ""those are steer, why the sense of pride?""  Silly, I know, but hook-em-horns y'all!

Wear a hat and drink plenty of water year round, the Arizona sun is a killer and the desert climate is every bit as dry as you can't even imagine.  Ideally one would go during the winter, the weather is mild enough i suspect the animals are out basking and you won't suffer heat stroke trying to spy the elusive wild dogs or the cheetahs.

I recommend this zoo to anyone passing through or if you're a native to the area.  Somehow the zoo tends to lift my spirits and makes me feel a bit smaller and less important in this world.  I like that idea, since some are under the impression that we can treat mother nature any way we please.  The zoo reminds me that there are more important things on this earth than a new car or what my 401K is doing this year.

We go at least 1 time per month and always have a great time. The volunteers are extremely friendly, we have only met 1 who was not. Even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo. We play at the water park then go straight home. 

We watch many families (parents) rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids don't have fun. With a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace. Sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals. Sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and don't stop at the animals at all. 

We love that the new Kimono Dragon exhibit is in, and are excited to see the Orangutan exhibit being started. My daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo. At 5 she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat. 

Now, I must say... If you have been to the San Diego zoo, please realize that the Phoenix Zoo can not compare. So, don't go to the Phoenix Zoo expecting anything more than a great zoo for education purposes. But, it is the 2nd best zoo I have been to.

Considering it was Saturday, it was extremely busy and we had to park in the area where the school busses normally park, which isn't a big deal, but it is a tid bit of a walk. We had passes, so we scooted our way past the entire line (which is pretty sweet, because you don't have to wait in line by all of the kids who are screaming and yelling because they're not getting to see the animals yet). 
The zoo isn't too huge, but we spent a good hour and a half there looking at all of the animals. 
My favorite exhibit is the giraffe one, and it is extremely cool that you can do the ""Giraffe Encounter"" where you get to get up close and personal with them. 
The food and the drinks are overpriced... I mean, seriously? $3.79 for a sno-cone? However, I don't blame you, Phoenix Zoo, all businesses pertaining to amusement tend to jack their prices up 500%.

I'm planning another ""back to Arizona"" trip, since I moved away from AZ for about 5 years, and missed AZ so much that I just HAD to come back. I went to the Kansas Zoo, and wow, was it HORRIBLE! There was next to nothing compared to the Phoenix Zoo. I remember going and hearing people say how Amazing it was, then after actually going to it, it made me miss and appreciate the Phoenix Zoo even more. 

This place is huge, and has a really cute lay out. I don't know why so many people said it was a bad lay out, or not a good zoo. Everytime I've went, the animals were out and about. We even saw bear cubs wrestling with each other while the mother/father watched. A white bird kept saying ""hello pretty"" to me, and ""no!"" to my brother, hahaha.  

They now have the up close giraffe exhibit, as someone else mentioned. They never had that when I was growing up, so I'm really excited to go and see how that is.

I give this zoo a 5/5 stars, because I've never once had a problem. For the people complaining about strollers, I completely agree but it's expected when people have so many kids now a days :( Makes it sort of hard for the ones that don't have kids to enjoy stuff when you have 5 kids and 3 strollers in front of you, or on your toes. 

The gift shops are great! Sure, they may be a tad overpriced, but when are gift shops not over priced? Exactly.

Don't forget zoo lights. I don't know of any other Zoo's that have it, but if you have a zoo with zoo lights, consider yourself lucky, and go to one immediately . If you don't have one, come to the Phoenix Zoo around Christmas time, and see the zoo lights. It's so pretty, and puts you in such a great Christmas mood.

I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, which has good zoos full of cold weather animals. The Phoenix Zoo is full of hot weather animals (makes sense), but it really nicely laid out and has a ton to do. We had free passes that day, so we skipped the line and didn't have to pay, which probably colors my view a bit, but we walked around for 4 hours and saw almost every exhibit and habitat that we could, and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The Lions and the Rhino were amazing...The Jaguar was beautiful, and just paced around his area, like he was stalking prey. There is a cool baboon exhibit, and so many other animals that you can see, from Bighorn Rams to the Komodo Dragon. The coolest area is this wide open space with the giraffes, and it also has longhorns and ostriches. It's a huge space, and you can really see the animals run around be more natural. The elephant and turtles are pretty cool too. 

In other news, I had a kindred spirit moment at the otter habitat. True story:

I've always felt like my spirit animal is an otter (yeah, I said it), and when I went to see the otters, there was one outside laying on a log. After I'd been standing there a minute, he perked up, looked back at me and walked away into his little house thing. A few seconds later, TWO otters came out of the rocks and they came outside and swam around, ultimately ending up at a patch of grass right in front of the railing I was looking over, and both were staring at me. The guy next to me said ""wow, I've never seen them do this. I've been coming here regularly for more than a year and they always just hang out on the log"". I wasn't the only one that noticed the fact that the otters were clearly excited that I was there...Definitely one of my top animal/human moments so far in my life.

After the otter experience it was bound to be a 5 star day, but I also got to ride a camel...Yes, I rode a camel.

In short, the Phoenix Zoo is great. I've lived her almost two years and had never been. If you've yet to go, do it soon, and say hi to the otters for me.",review,0,LdhwY7eudLlx1KFQQe9GwA

Also, the zoo is well laid out and easy to navigate. There are plenty of spots to take a breather or to just sit back and experience the wildlife.

I love the recent addition of Stingray Bay. We had been to another zoo where we got to feed and pet the stingrays and was really disappointed that the Phoenix Zoo didn't have that, but then a year later they added Stingray Bay as a permanent addition. It's amazing! You can pet the stingrays, which feel like wet velvet, and then at specific feeding times, you can purchase food to feed them. It's kind of scary at first, but they are really gentle creatures and it's super fun! I could spend hours petting and feeding the stingrays. 

If you ever need something to do or want a great experience, definitely visit the zoo! I'd recommend going when it's cool out, especially since AZ gets so hot during the summer.

The meerkats are always a favorite on the Africa Trail, as are all the animals on the Children's Trail (but especially the Ocelot and the Wallabies).

A few months ago, I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center, and this past weekend, she invited my husband and me, along with some other very fortunate Yelpers, including David S B, Jason W, and Alexander C, to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing (according to her review, their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes). 

Just as at Szechwan Palace, the atmosphere of the restaurant was nothing special. In fact, it was a little messy, at least in the little area with the large round table where they sat us - we were surrounded by all of these rows of boxes and random containers. Oh, well - atmosphere aside, the service was friendly and prompt (our waters were always kept full), and the food was incredible. So that you are able to order some more authentic items, I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu (which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review): 

*Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture (reminded me of octupus) and a vinegary sauce. Reminded me of kim chi, which I love. 
*Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles (same texture as Chow Fun) in a savory light sauce with fresh, crunchy vegetables
*1/2 crispy duck - Tender meat with crispy skin; served with Hoisin sauce
*""Ants Climbing Up a Tree"" - Unusual name but tasty dish. It was vermicelli (thin noodles) with a minced meat and chili sauce. 
*Whole salt and pepper shrimp - These were crispy and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper coating. The shrimp themselves were a little fishy, though. Highly recommend eating them whole (including the eyes!)
*Beef tendon and tripe in scallion oil - I wasn't wild about the texture, but the spicy sauce was really savory and flavorful.
*Soup dumplings - Little dumplings filled with soup broth that you have to eat in one big bite. They were good, but I preferred the ones that we had at Szechwan Palace. 
*Fish pieces w/ sauce - I could be wrong, but I think these were  the ""spicy soybean paste with sliced fish"" from the menu. They were very bony and difficult to eat, but I enjoyed the flavor. 
*Peking spare ribs - Delicious! Had the most savory sauce and really tender meat. 
*Drunken chicken - Not a huge fan of this dish. The chicken was a bit dry, instead of falling off the bone, and the skin wasn't crispy at all. 
*Chopped Shanghainese greens with tofu in sesame oil  - Served cold. Was really flavorful and light and would be great as a vegetarian appetizer. 
*Sauteed ""snake"" gourd with soy beans - To the best of my knowledge, this consisted of pieces of sauteed squash with soy beans in a clear, mild sauce. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the perfect complement. 
*Steamed and deep-fried bun - This came in the shape of a long roll that we had to cut into individual pieces. It was delicious doughy and slightly crispy on the outside and was fabulous dipped in some chili sauce. 
*Green onion pancake - This has always been one of my favorite authentic Chinese dishes and has a wonderful mealy texture. Again, excellent dipped in chili sauce!
*Deep-fried shredded potato - Being that we went at 11:30 on a Sunday, my eye was drawn to this hash-brown-like dish. Didn't regret my choice because it was delicious. Comprised of undercooked and crunchy potato slices in a sauce with chiles. 

One note - nothing we got was ridiculously spicy, but the chili sauce that comes on the table allows you to spice everything to taste and added flavor (and not just mind-numbing heat) to every dish I tried. 

15 dishes! I may have forgotten to mention a dish or two, but as you can see, we had a veritable Shanghai feast! In this day and age, feasts usually cost a pretty penny, but the 9 of us walked out having only spent $20 each.

I've spent a fair amount of time in China and their dishes are as close as I've been able to find to actually replicating dishes that I saw in China. Though I sadly miss spicy frog dishes in china, they have a chicken version here. (ie. please add spicy froggy!!! hint hint) 

They have classics like preserved egg, wonderful Chinese veggies, etc.

El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. 

We showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.

I came here with some of my classmates one evening after class at ASU.  Luckily, two of them were native Mandarin speakers, as well as my professor having lived in China for a couple of years, so they were all business when it came down to ordering food.

Since going to this restaurant, I am addicted.  There is no other word for it.  My friend and I go at least once a week where we order the same things.  In fact, we go so often that we are immediately seated at the same table by the staff, and sometimes not even given menus.  

What do we eat?  We eat: cold noodles (liang fen), fuqi feipian (cold spicy beef tripe, tongue, and other parts), and water-boiled beef (we ask for it extra-spicy).  

After numbing your mouth, I suggest taking a sip of water OR ordering a Tsingtao beer.  You'll be amazed at how sweet tasting the beer is!

I am moving out of the Phoenix area to New England soon, and I am more than distraught that I will no longer be able to enjoy Szechuan Palace.  I've threatened to kidnap the chef, but I'm not sure he'd enjoy being stored in my kitchen.

1. the first paco-less costco did not have kosher hot dogs, the one that did have paco did have kosher hot dogs.
2. the irony in this is that apparently the paco costco that DOES have kosher hot dogs is in the goyshe neighborhood where while the paco- less costco is where all the jews go but cannot eat kosher (most of us eat bacon twice daily so i dont really get the kosher thing) (but i had to hear about the irony of this from my mother 8 times that day)

Anyways, here is the deal. costco rocks. i dont like the requirement to join, but they give to lefty causes, so im a fan. if you know what computer you want, and they happen to have it, this is the place to get it. here is why:
A. you get a free 2 year warranty
B. you get a third year FREE if you charge computer on an american express
C. it is cheaper than best buy or other places.

This location is very close to my house, so we go here all the time. Maybe a little too often...

But since it's so close, it's nice to check out the new inventory that they're getting all the time. I like to look at all the Big Screen TV's... patiently saving and waiting for the one I'm gonna buy someday. (I seem to only watch reality shows though..ha!)

I also like to check out their book section - - to see what new non-fiction finds they have here. Plus everybody always goes to Costco for the samples. Sometimes they have some really good stuff on sample. And it does work... we do buy the sampled stuff every once and a while. 

This location also has the Pharmacy section, Optical, and of course gasoline. We pretty much ONLY buy our gasoline here. I've calculated it's anywhere from 15c to 20c cheaper than other gas stations nearby. 

And the Pharmacy dept - - love that I can buy items here with my HSA card, but you have to use that card when purchasing back in that department. 

Staff is always friendly...

I'm sure that I'm responsible for a good percentage of their revenue every year, as this place is where I spend a good sum of money.  One of the great things about Costco is their pricing policies - they are not gonna gouge you, from the gas pumps to the glasses, you can get name-brand quality items at decent prices.

I've tried comparing them to big-box retailers that try to compete, and unless the big-box is running a loss-leader, Costco always comes out on top.

Parking at this location is decent, there are some trees in the lot which provide premium parking - if you can get a shady spot, but otherwise the lot is big and logically arranged.  It's a bit of a hassle getting in and out of the the gas station area, but the always lower pump prices make it worth it.

The staff here are always helpful and will look up items you could not find, the optomotrist is a great and funny guy with an easy-going style and the eyeglass department is staffed with knowledgable and helpful people.

I have one tip about shopping at Costco, if you see something you like, buy it before it runs out because some items may not return.  I've passed up some great deals this way, and regretted it much later.

The optical center at Costco is also top-notch. The doctor is a cool guy who makes an eye exam worth having. I would not want any other optometrist! The desk assistant, Sharon, is super kind. The other sales associates in that department, Destiny and Erica, truly brighten my day--as if Costco hadn't already accomplished that feat!!

Single beers here are cheaper than what you'll find at the bar. Granted, although it comes chilled, you can't open it on the spot. Wouldn't it be great if you could? (Beer tasting, anyone?!)

If you're not fond of beer (my god, what's the matter with you?), then peruse the liquor or wine selection. You can even find Mexican tequila that isn't your typical Jose.

How lucky for us Valley folk that he took that idea a couple steps further and opened a lunch spot.

And, boy, does he bake bread here - that's what makes the sandwiches at Pane Bianco unforgettable. It's like ciabatta meets pita bread in a wood-fired oven - and every bit as good as his pizza dough. Add to that some of the best meats, cheeses and other deliciousness available and you've got one heck of a great sandwich. 

I'm usually partial to whatever the market sandwich happens to be - especially the prosciutto, sausage or braseola - though the always-on-the-menu sopressata can be every bit as tasty (note: sometimes the salami is sliced really thick and I prefer thinner slices; also the red peppers are great, but I kind of miss the olive tapenade they use to use.)

Focaccia here is also a don't miss and flavors change daily. I think it's best when there's tomato, caramelized onions and a hard cheese; definitely asked for it warmed up. Not a big fan of the lemon rosemary, but I'm sure that appeals to some palates.

They are only open for lunch(  11am-3pm), and I recommend avoiding stopping by during the height of lunch hour.  On a side note, there is no indoor dining.  Seating is limited to wooden tables and benches out front that are shared with the customers of Lux. 

I always introduce friends and co-workers to this place.  and everytime we leave its the same reaction.... Wow!

I usually go for the Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil sandwich.  This thing is crazy delicious.  And when people say fresh, they mean it.  Its perfect and the bread is insanely delicious (chewy and crunchy all at the same time).  The same goes for any sandwich you might choose here.

You have weird hours, an overwhelming ""not quite industrial, not quite rustic"" decor, and your $8 Mozzarella, Tomato and Basil salad consists of a cut up tomato and a few, uh, ""slugs"" of mozzarella topped with soggy basil leaves. 

But the real reason I want to hate you is that you duped me. You bamboozled, shanghaied and probably even Kansas City Shuffled me too.

You lured me into this false sense of disappointment with my tiny salad and loaf of bread rolled up in a piece of paper.

You watched me eat it too, didn't you?

You saw me take a big chunk out of one of those cheese slugs. You watched me enjoying that salad. That delicious, gooey salad.

And you liked it, didn't you? You liked watching me scarf down that salad like it was an item from a value menu. You got a sick kick out of seeing me tear through that bread like I'd never had it so good. 

You bastard.

I want to hate you. I want to give you two stars and rant and rave about how you teh lame.

But I can't. I just can't. 

That salad was just, like, whoa. That had to be the freshest mozzarella and the freshest tomatoes I'd ever tasted.

It made olive garden salad taste like bagged lettuce doused in olive oil.

And if Subway made bread as fresh as yours, I would stop going in there periodically to order the seafood sensation (toasted!) just to watch the employees and other patrons moan and cringe. 

I want to hate you. But that bait and switch, luring me in with that ""too cool for you"" vibe and then hitting me up with some flava, that takes skill. That takes cunning.

And as a woman who spent her youth tying bedsheets around her neck and trying to burn the neighbor's house down with her mind, I appreciate cunning.

Four stars for being cunning, and one star for being leaps and bounds of awesome ahead of Lux.

The shop is a tiny little spot on a pretty desolate strip, but the throng of people eating their sandwiches at the (generously shaded) outdoor tables were a clear indication that we had found our spot.

We ordered the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich and the market special (slow roasted lamb) sandwich to share.  The sandwiches are served on thin foccacia rounds fresh from the wood-burning oven -- light and crunchy on the outside without being greasy or spongy (ick!) like the foccacia we've sampled at lesser places.  At the same time, the foccacia at Bianco has enough heft to keep from getting soggy if you save the sandwiches for later.  The lamb sandwich was phenomenal - tender, well-seasoned, fork-tender shredded meat with just the right amount of greens.   The mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich was delicious as well.  

The sandwiches were so good that we stopped back here on our last day in Phoenix to get some take-out for our plane ride home.  This time, we opted for the soppressata sandwich with aged provolone and roasted peppers and the market (goat cheese and arugula) sandwich.  Wow.

While many say that pizzeria bianco (the other place by the owner) is overrated, no such statement can be made here.

Both share Chris Bianco's dedication to using only the freshest, locally-sourced ingredients.  Pane Bianco features home-made bread baked in on-site wood ovens, hand made mozzarella, basil and greens out of Chris's own garden, and high quality meats from locally owned Schneider sausage. You can't get more local, or better quality than this. 

Pane Bianco has the added benefit of being a sandwich counter, which means you don't have to wait hours for a taste of deliciousness.  Although as others have mentioned at the lunch peak you may have to wait a few minutes; after all quality can't be rushed.  Take the opportunity to grab a coffee next door, or better yet, get to know your fellow sandwich fanatics--this is how community is built.  

If you are looking for an infinite selection of sub-par ingredients, or care more about price than quality, there are several other sandwich shops for you. so please don't bother coming here. And if the idea of ordering along side individuals who don't look like suburban clones scare you, this likely isn't your place either.  Check out one of the approximately 1,912 other sandwich shops in strip-malls throughout the Valley that cater to your tastes.  But if the freshest,and highest quality ingredients, knowledgeable service and authentic surroundings are are important to you, Pane Bianco is your type of place.

And if you do value quality over quantity, and authenticity over generica, but still feel that $8 bucks is a little steep for you in the current economic climate, share with a friend. The portions are generous enough to share and still feel satisfied. (although be sure to snap the chocolate treat for yourself!)",review,3,kvL7bId7FbaMi19TFl3h9w

It's no big secret that I'm a huge fan of Chris Bianco. His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.

If you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.

Ordering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. 

I can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. 

Served on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. 

Bianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.

If you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.

Now if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.",review,7,lPaYMDmJbAnv_3pmZH_inw

It was a great sandwich and I would definitely get it again.  My wife got the sopressata sandwich and this time it was a little different.  Usually it has roasted red peppers, but for whatever reason today it had some sauteed/grilled onions.  Still tasty might I add, but the combo of roasted red peppers was better in my opinion.

  I am Hesitant, do I write this review or not?!
  I mean if I do not... I could plead the intoxication of FEZ's Fabulous sugar-rimmed WatermelonMargaritas (which come with genuine GummiWorms to ""Lure"" You).
 
  The 23rd of September was one of those RollerCoaster rides with My Mate.  At first He's, ""I just want a small salad, I am kind of still full from lunch.""  To, having the FullOn yummy monthly DinnerSpecial at FEZ, ~Crispy Chicken Cordon Bleu~ it came with a side of perfectly cooked spinach (which I did get a taste of).  We arrived at HappyHour and the WatermelonMargaritas were 2-4-1, so of course...

  Next, We headed North toward the next LightRail station, yet not before heading to LUX, where We realized We were not prepared to wait... They were a bit busy. 
  I suggested We pop into Pane Bianco for a loaf of bread from, Their wood burning oven.  We didn't even make it through the (new) front door before, the aroma of pizza hit Us.   After drinking like a fish and nibblin' on GummiWorms, I was so ready for pizza. 
  They only offer 4 different types of pizza from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.;

MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh MozzarellaCheese, Basil
MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic without Cheese
ROSA - Red Onion, ParmesanCheese, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios
BIANCOVERDE - Fresh MozzarellaCheese, ParmesanCheese, RicottaCheese, Arugula 

  You would think it would not be a  difficult choice, think again.  I finally narrowed it down to the Rosa only to be told by the sweet, petite, CounterGirl that the Bakers were still getting Their game on, so I could have a second pizza for free. 
  TooMuch for My alcohol infused GreyMatter to process, Mate tells Her to make the second one a Margherita.

  Okay so here's My Dilemma, do I even try to tell You how IndescribablyGood, a pizza with ArizonaGrown pistachios is/can be. That a wood burning oven cooks a pizza in less than 10 minutes, so We were in and out in less than 20 minutes. That soon Pane Bianco will be attempting another form of seduction by serving, Crow's Dairy Gelato.

After a stop at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market, we were both hungry and finally agreed to head to PB.  I hate to admit this, but it was my first time there... I had high expectations and PB delivered!  

We sat outside on the picnic tables instead of taking advantage of the full service inside.  We shared a tomato mozzarella sandwich and a tuna salad.  Both were delicious!  Melt in your mouth delicious!  We also brought home their market sandwich for our babysitter (aka my mother-in-law).  It was a vegetable sandwich which she said was delicious.

Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.

Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.

Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.

There is plenty of outside seating that they share with Lux, but I'm not too sure if they will serve you outside (definitely not if you're planning on having a glass of wine).

I ordered the mozzarella sandwich which came on a warm focaccia bread... it was such a nice touch. The mozzarella was fresh and ample. The basil was fresh without any dents, blackening on corner leaves or bruising from being ripped/chopped- any of the such that often arrives on such sandwiches.

* Serves same pizza as Pizzeria Bianco but has spacious seating *

before going to the airport, we had two more hours to kill. decided to check out Lux Cafe and what do we see?  PANE BIANCO!!! 

IT'S A SIGN!! heheh.  we were planning to visit pizzeria bianco and pane bianco on our weekend getaway. thought we were going to leave phoenix without it but we already dined at pizzeria bianco. we weren't planning to actually eat too much. no pizza this time since we wanted to try other items.

it's a HUGE space. i recommend people to visit pane bianco versus pizzeria bianco since you can 1) seat more, 2) there isn't a line, 3) they serve the pizza. in fact, i like the rustic decor. brendan told us that lux cafe used to be in half the space until they acquired their own building next door. pane bianco was able to become much bigger.

i was asking brendan so many questions, cuz that's what i do!! haha..
he was more knowledgeable than the waitresses at pizzeria bianco or the cashier girl at pane bianco. guess it's not everyday people like me appear.  brendan was probably thinking that that was the reason they tell you what they use, the process, the history when he was hired to work there. some diner like me would be testing him. (he passed. heheh)

on the board, there is a daily special. happy hour is 3-7pm daily -- $2 off beers.
(the foccacia sandwiches are on the lunch menu)

complimentary bread with EVOO. i felt that the bread here was slightly better than the one at pizzeria bianco. but really, it's the same bread.

meatballs (side order) - i had my eyes on the meatballs...staring at the photos on the computer screen, so i knew this was what we were having. 3 good sized meatballs made from GRASS FED BEEF with crushed tomato sauce that was divine and a basil leaf. LOVE LOVE!!! 

market salad - they change it up daily/monthly but they follow a flavor palate. this time, it was a lighly dressed citrus viniagrette on a bed of arugula, oranges, candied pecans, and goat cheese. just what we were looking for.

when we were at pizzeria bianco, we were so full that we didn't get to try dessert.

this time, we ordered the vanilla rice pudding. when i was reading about it, other people said that it was enough for two.  well, it was a much more generous portion than i had imagined!!  it was topped with boysenberry jam and not too sweet.  perfect ending to our 'light' meal'.

there are currently two pizzeria biancos (we didn't go to the other location) and one pane bianco. plans are in the works to expand adding a pizzeria bianco in tucson for the future.

LAST STOP, Pane Bianco.

All joking aside, let's talk about what makes anything Bianco great. It's a no-fuss menu with simple, homegrown ingredients in each dish. Nothing is complicated. It's fresh, it's delicious, and it's everything you want in a pizza or a sandwich.

Pane stands up to this testament. When I first went here with my boyfriend because he was adamant about having a sandwich and exclaimed this was the best sandwich in town, I have to admit I was neither impressed nor enthusiastic about the selection of sammies. I was like, ""why does each sandwich only have, like, three ingredients including the bread?"" I wanted some mayo-lined, cheese-filled meat tower with a pillowy outer layer of white bread.

What an idiot. Why does each sandwich only have 3 ingredients including the bread? Because that's all they need! My sandwich had roasted red peppers (roasted in-house) and some kind of salame; I think sopressata but I can't remember for sure. Oh, and bread. Fresh-baked bread. Made that morning. It was heaven in my mouth.

So if you know what's good for you, you will go to Pane and order a flippin' sandwich. Don't get your hopes up for mayo, you won't get. But you also won't want it or need it once have a single bite.

Authentic British style Pub...enough said. George & Dragon is fabulous! On the outside it looks mediocre at best, though the British feel is felt as soon as you walk in and see all the different Football Club Flags, Football Jerseys, (Soccer for you non-British) and UK country flags, and other miscellaneous pub paraphernalia. Inside, the place is warm and inviting, the tables have the Union Jack, English Cross, and London Underground Logos on them. The crescent shape booths are comfortable, and the bar has ample seating. This is place you go to with friends, or a date, and just spend hours talking over some pints.  The music is chosen by the patrons via a ""secret"" jukebox, so it can vary from Van Morrison, to Curtis Mayfield, to Outkast.  I went with my favorite pub ""friend', one that we can just talk for several hours and not really notice the time, so it made the experience that much more enjoyable. This is really a place you can just loose track of time and amount of pints consumed, as you expect to walk outside and hop on some form of public transportation and make your way back to your flat (apartment for you non-British). I guess the war zone that is Central Ave, will bring us a form of transportation in this area, but judging by the condition of this road, we have a bit of time to wait.  As I was waiting for my friend I chatted up a guy sitting outside about how I drove from The Roosevelt to G&D on Central Ave. He asked me ""what do you have a 4x4?"" and was serious. I said ""No I have a Golf, but it's German.""  Moral of this story, avoid Central Ave. at all costs.  
The one small downside, (bathroom issue) is the size of the bathrooms, they have just one toilet,  for men and one for women, which really is meant  for just one person at a time. In traditional European fashion,  I was ""doubled up on"".  As I went in to relieve myself, a dude just followed me in and was planning on using the above mentioned toilet, as I took the urinal.  I said ""Hey, you doubling up in here?"" He proceeded to respond ""Hey we are guys, it's cool"" This is the type of place that doubling up in the men's bathroom is OK, it just adds to th charm, hey you could triple up here, as they do have a sink as well. ;)",review,5,HfwO9GnaP-9VdI0afwgmrA

It was by the grace of a good friend that I stopped off for a happy hour special at a Midtown drinkery. That's all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard day's work. And the proximity of George & Dragon to the light rail launched what is my current obsession.

With good intentions, I stopped at G&D yesterday for an Irish Car Bomb and a Guinness, and to get some food to take home and watch a movie. At 5:15 there was hardly anybody there, but I suppose most people are commuting at that time. I overheard another patron ask about their ""Slay The Dragon"" program. Participants, it so happens, are given a card with all of the restaurant's beer listed. The steady drinker consumes one of each (there are 66 different beers!!) within a month and is awarded with an ""I Slayed the Dragon"" t-shirt. What a sweet concept! ***

The steak and kidney pie was also a nice treat, with that certain crispness of the kidney strong but not overpowering. In the past, I've also gotten the fish and chips (FanTasTic!), bangers and mash (excellent) and the wings (very good).

I've been going to Salon Estique for almost 15 years now - yes, that includes through college and graduate school, when I lived in other states. I purposefully flew back to go to Salon Estique, that's how great it is! (Don't worry, I also flew back to see family too!)

I've had nearly every service done at Salon Estique, but my favorites are the facials and waxing by Liz or Faye, as well as the haircuts and color.

For facials and waxing, you cannot do better than either Liz or Faye. Both are excellent, dedicated professionals who will NOT up-sell you on unnecessary products (ladies, you know what I'm talking about). There are several types of facial options available: one for teens, an Express Facial (~45 min.), and a full facial, which is ~90 minutes long.

I've done both, although the full facial is a better deal because not only do you get the facial, but you also get an eyebrow wax for the same price. Taking care of 2 things at once? Yes, please!

Liz and Faye do other types of waxing, which I won't go into detail about here, but let's just say... all the waxing they do is NOT painful, they do NOT re-use sticks (so, no infections or gross things, hooray!), and they're very aware of your pain tolerance and preferences. 

As for haircut and color... I admit, I have had my hair cut and colored at other salons. The haircuts were okay, but no one can color like the Salon Estique ladies. Peggy, Laurie, and Eva are my favorites! They thoroughly listen to what you want, bring over color swatches to make sure you both are on the same page, and they provide ideas if you are unsure. 

The ladies (and gents!) work with your face shape for haircuts, as well as the amount of time you'd like to spend on your hair. I've never been up-sold any products, and everyone I've worked with for hair coloring has always made sure I LOVE my color before I leave. They will re-do it for you if you don't like it! Just say something!

I love how everyone remembers your name here, and everyone on staff checks in with you to make sure everything is okay (ex. when you're waiting for your color to dry - staff checks in, brings you a magazine if you need it, and will bring you refreshments if you request it). Eva and Laurie always give me advice on hairstyles when I'm at a loss, and of course, they're fun and make a long day (I've got long hair--takes a while to color!) go much faster.

Message me if you have any questions-- as a 15 year customer (and I'm still in my 20s, so that says something!), there's much more about the salon and services that I don't mention here, but that I've had done, and I'd be happy to answer any other questions.",review,2,YgucNL2tibnjEmDLqHPqow
12258,5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg,7,2008-07-07,4,-_MxsXJL4rTqDbZyoucTmg,5,"I love Bikram Yoga, and I especially love this studio.

Because of some recent changes in my life, I've committed myself to doing certain things to improve myself as a person. I've done yoga in the past on a regular basis - and those were the times I felt spiritually and physically lighter. 

If you're not familiar with Bikram, he's this Indian yogi who came up with a series of asanas, or poses, which are designed to increase blood flow to all the organs and muscles and tissues. The focus required is very mind clearing. The poses, performed in a 107 or so degree room, are designed to compress and stretch muscles and organs - compressing to push out blood, and stretching to fill them with fresh blood. Your body will eliminate many stored toxins. You'll lose weight and develop better muscle tone and you will feel mentally wonderful. The closest thing i can describe the feeling I have after 90 minutes of Bikram is to being high on drugs. Only you aren't - you've done something wonderful for yourself. 

This particular studio is a Bikram franchise run by a lovely woman named Brooke. She has been practicing Yoga for years and when you meet her you'll see how it's effects radiate outward from her. There's a very inspirational story in an old New Times about her and how she came to do yoga. Literally - it saved her life. 

The studio is at Central and Camelback, near AJ's, way way in the back corner and very easy to miss. Just to to the corner, past the fountain, and look to your left. 

All the instructors are superb - they all have to be officially certified to teach Bikram. The studio is very clean. It is a very comfortable and peaceful environment. The instructors and other students are very friendly. The mens and womens dressing rooms are equipped with showers. You will sweat like you have never sweated before.

They have all kinds of specials for new members, and a number of different membership types ranging from blocks of classes to unlimited monthly membership. If you're starting out I suggest reading about Bikram Yoga first so you're prepared. Bring water, bring a large towel, bring a small towel. Dress comfortably. Take your shoes off at the door. You can rent a yoga mat if you're just trying it out for a couple dollars. 

I've been to a few other studios around town and this one is my absolute favorite.",review,10,HZeFzs42f0iGaA-sP_hUnA

This is by FAR the best bikram studio in the valley.  Its got the best vibe, the best staff, and the best environment.  Other places I've tried were super crowded.  I walked away more stressed than when I walked in.  While lying in savasana at the end of a class in Scottsdale people were hurdling over me and vying for spots for the next class.  Not fun.   If you want an awesome, relaxing, fulfilling experience this is the spot.

I'm not a connoisseur of other people's technique  . . . ahem, but from what I've seen and experienced, the teachers are knowledgeable and friendly and the other practitioners seem happy and healthy and hey, isn't that the point?",review,2,utHO9N7WyeBqpkE-WPVJHA

My beef with previous experiences has been that the instructors would push beginners too much and tailor their classes to experienced students. Very intimidating. My husband bought me a 30 day pass he got on Groupon for $15. So, if there was ever a time to try it, this would be it. I had been really stressed at work and needed some purification! My first class was on a Sat at 2pm. The 2pm weekend classes tend to be slowest and apparently the midday classes during the week. I wouldn't know about midday during the week since I work a normal 9-5 job but that was what the instructor told me. I have also gone to their mid-week 7pm classes that tend to be very busy. But, I don't feel this hindered me at all. The classes are 90 minutes and apparently you can burn 800-1200 calories during a session. The sessions can be intense but what was really nice was how accepting the instructors are towards beginners. They are more concerned with doing the posture right than how far you can push yourself. They are also okay if you need to sit down as long as you try to stay in the room the whole time. This is such a friendly studio and I agree with the other review that the instructors/employees seem genuinely uplifted and happy. They love what they do and it shows. Come hydrated, be prepared to sweat buckets, and take advantage of all this studio has to offer.",review,4,RxfFQxUtSIGYwTKU_rvAeg
12292,5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg,4,2012-08-24,2,Lzrk7mA5ad7V31fwdB5YnQ,5,"Back in July, a few of us girls at work found a living social coupon for this place for $20 for $20 classes.  Being that we all could use a little more exercise in our lives, I bought the coupon and started going to classes.

The Yoga studio is tucked away in a shopping center off Central and Camelback behind AJ's fine foods, and next to a hair salon.  

The basis of ""hot"" yoga is to do 26 yoga positions in a room held at 105 degrees with 40% humidity for 90 minutes.  This allows you to flush all the toxins from your body, speeds up your metabolism, reduces stress levels and basically cleanses your whole body while you get a good healthy workout. Intense? Yes, but not impossible.  You will sweat everything out, literally. I admit, like others here, you feel like quitting 15 minutes in because you think your going to die from the heat and your sweaty as hell, but KEEP GOING. IT GETS EASIER/BETTER. I cannot begin to tell you how awesome I felt after my first class. Just amazing!

For starters, even if your a beginner, like me, do not be intimidated! The class is welcoming to students of ALL levels. I've only been to one other yoga class before in my life, and that was 4 years ago.  Here are a few pointers to help you out and tell you more about the studio itself.

A) drink an enourmous amount of water before, during and after class! Especially  the day before class. The day before drink, drink drink! You will sweat like no other during class, and you need to stay hydrated.  Drink a lot of water after class, as your body is going to be dehydrated and you will be flushing toxins out of your body.  Also, when you bring water to class, make sure its frozen before hand.  If you don't, it'll be warm in 5 minutes and useless.  The studio does sell water bottles, but its like $3 a bottle.  You can go to Circle K and get one for a dollar, throw it in your freezer, and take it to class with you.

B) bring a big towel to put over your mat.  Your going to need it to collect the sweat, and to wipe your face and body periodically during class.  It also allows you not to slip on your mat when you do the standing poses for the first half of class.  The studio does rent towels, but it costs a few bucks. I bring a beach towel with me and it gets soaked by the end of class from sweating!

The studio itself is spacious, but fills up quickly.  You want to make sure you get a spot where you can see yourself in the mirror while you work out.  It allows you to perfect your poses as the instructor talks you through the class, helps you become more limber and stay focused.  I personally like to sit off to the right side because during class while the instructor is walking through the studio, they will open the doors and you can get a blast of cool air.  This my friends, is the most refreshing thing ever.  Sit off to the side near the door! You will thank me later!

The instructors themselves are really positive and encouraging.  My first class ever was with this girl Melissa, and she made me feel right at home, explaining everything! Each pose has a benefit for your body, and she (along with the other instructors) will tell you what its for. For example, there's one where you lay on your back and pull your legs to your chest- that's great for digestion, another for reducing anxiety, others for expanding your lungs and so on.  They also tell you to work at your own pace. Don't kill yourself! There's skill levels of all kinds here, and you'll notice it in class. 

I would go to classes with my friend Nicolle from work, and we had a blast. Each instructor brings their own personality to class, but you follow the same routine every single time. Some will work you harder then others, but again, go at your own pace.  If you feel like you need a break, lay down on your mat, or do the downward dog position like I do and pick up at the next position after you regain your composure.

The only downside to the studio is the studio itself smells funky! I wish they would spray some febreeze in here or something, because I think it smells! Aside from that, I really enjoyed my time here, and would love to go back in a heartbeat. Staff was awesome, positive and encouraging.  Plenty of class times available, and a great way to get back in shape.",review,6,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg
12293,5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg,1,2012-08-24,2,OOz-Cy1f0iek-foxmqi9Hw,5,"Having never done yoga before, I was a bit apprehensive when a few of us decided to take advantage of a $20 for 20 classes Living Social coupon. To jump straight into Bikram was a bit scary! And I have to admit the first session was brutal as I kept glancing at the clock and wondering why it was taking so long for 90 minutes to pass!

I have to say it gets better though as you go on, I only managed to go three times I believe and by the three time the class passed by in a whirl as I was already getting the hang of it down!

The nice thing about this studio is that Bikram is the only thing they offer and their classes are always the same so eventually you can get into a rhythm and know what moves you have coming up without having to glance around the room wondering what everyone is doing next. Not that the direction isn't good, it's great! I experienced three different teachers and each of them was very informative, informing us what the position was called and how to move into it. I just have mild right-left confusion so I had to spy on my classmates to make sure I was doing everything right.

The thing I liked the most is that these classes attract a variety of people so you don't have to feel like you're the newbie slinking in to a class of yoga masters in great shape. To say that that would have been intimidating is an understatement. They're very encouraging of newcomers and actually the first time we went the instructor overheard we were new and had everyone give us a round of applause for surviving the class. 

Classes are available daily at different times to suit those of you who don't work during the day and those who do. There is only one room since there's only one class going at a time but it's spacious and there's room for a lot of people. The room does smell but with everyone sweating in there constantly I'm not too surprised. They provide some sprays to wipe your mat down with after class and the instructor usually hangs out at the front desk if you want to have a quick chat or say thanks. 

Even though my coupon is up I can see myself coming back here if I'm ever wanting a Bikram fix. The nice thing is that they have class packages you can purchase through their site that you don't have to worry about using up in a certain time. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great Bikram only studio.",review,4,FqJILOiDtVXXydwG2zEf4A

I became obsessed with Electra Townies after riding one.  I am a nerdy, middle-aged mom who just wanted a fun bike to ride with my kid.  I don't know from mountain bikes or road bikes.  After calling all over town and looking on the internet, a friend told me about Slippery Pig and how nice and helpful they were.  I called and they had my dream bike in stock, and at more than $100 less than I'd been able to find on the 'net.

When I went in to see the bike, the little store was packed with hard-core cycling enthusiasts, talking about races and the virtues of various bike parts I had never heard of.  The lone guy running the store was courteous and took his time with each customer.

Did I mention I know nothing about bikes?  Sometimes I hate going into specialty shops because the ""experts"" there are just socially maladjusted snobs with their little corner of knowledge, and they lord that over you to assert their superiority.  I was a little nervous, because the Pig was definitely a ""real"" bike shop.  But when it was my turn for assistance, my man Eli was nothing but nice.  Maybe the nicest guy ever.

Even though it was past closing, he took his time going over the bike, gave me a beverage, offered me a discount, told me about the three free tune-ups I get for the next year, and gave me 20% off all accessories (because you know you have to trick out the new bike).

When I went back a week later to get my basket attached, again at closing time, he remembered my name and seemed genuinely interested in what I thought of my bike.  George attached my basket, and I agree with the previous reviewer: he's great, too.

I went in again last night to get a flat fixed, and this latest experience prompted me to write this review.  Again, I rolled in minutes to closing, and they fixed my flat right away, staying until well after closing.  But while I waited, Eli offered me my choice of delicious microbrews (!) and I sipped a lovely Four Peaks Kiltlifter Scottish Ale while they fixed my flat and attached a new saddle!  Where does that happen anymore?

For context, I had taken my daughter's bike in to another LBS a year ago, and they took two days to fix the flat.  They were also nice guys, but two days to fix a flat?  (And no beer.  I think I am going to make free beer a prerequisite for service providers from now on.)

These guys are just the best, and reminded me why it is almost always worth it to seek out small, independent businesses.  Thanks, Slippery Pig!",review,6,z6hvsvWDH7N2Ch59ZQMbtA

I returned that afternoon and when I walked in, the first thing he  said was  ""are you the one that wanted your daughter's  flat fixed?""  I said yes, and he brought  the bike up front, flat fixed.

And, let's be frank, anything that reminds me of bacon is bound to catch my attention.

Upon entering that Sunday morning, I immediately smell bacon. Turns out, one of the techs was cooking some up in the back. So I showed him my ink and he offered me a piece. They did an initial inspection of my bike and told me it would be done by Wednesday. Unfortunately, I needed a new back tire because the spokes kept popping out.

I spoke with the mechanics in the back who treated me with respect and knowledge.  There was no snobbery or attitude (which has happened to me at other shops in response to my atypical bike rider appearence (middleaged, overweight business professional)). I ride a european bike which has some rarer parts and features and the guys were ready to work with it, no issues.

 I love this shop in particular because of several reasons which I will in turn explain below:
 -Location; centrally located along the light rail, it's super convenient for folks like me, who, once their bike has gone out of commission need an alternate means of transport. It's literally across the street from a light rail stop. Also it's right next door to Lux and Panne Bianco, so while your bike is getting some fine tuning you can go grab a delicious panini and chill outside in the fairer weather or lounge inside Lux with the hip kids sipping inky coffee to music from before their time. 
 -Customer Service; a lot of bike shops can be like mechanics garages, filled with gear heads that toss around jargon and tools with grease covered hands, intimidating and emasculating you about your lack of knowlege and inadequacy as a cyclist. Not at Slippery Pig, these dudes know their stuff and they're more than willing to share that wisdom. They aren't condescending and they're super helpful. It's also a family/doggy friendly shop.
 -Price; If you're shopping for a new bike this might not be the cheapest spot. However if you're after parts or need some repairs the dudes at the S.P. won't charge you an arm and a leg...or a belly and a loin.
 I'd gladly recommend anybody here and as far as I'm concerned this is the best bike shop in Cen_Pho.",review,8,pv82zTlB5Txsu2Pusu__FA

I hate those places.

More often than not, a hairdresser who's busy adding products and whipping out the curling iron is trying to style her way into a better haircut. And that just won't fly with me. Cuz when she pulls out that little hand mirror and spins me around, I want to see what the cut looks like, not what her Con-Air handiwork looks like.

That's why I trust Ide Mania's lovely and talented Amina, and only Amina, to give me a just-hip-enough, just-lazy-enough look that gets compliments with minimal effort. 

In the three years I've seen her, she's moved from a beautiful (but wretchedly run) Tempe salon a mile from my home to a former bank branch in downtown Phoenix.

She must have wooed me with her stylist charms. No, but seriously, this place was very chill, employees seemed happy to work there and very welcoming of the customers. I guess $60 may seem expensive to some but I felt like you got alot for it. I couldn't do this every month but could be persuaded to visit IDE Mania every 3 months. That seems more reasonable right???? What was cool, too, was that they let me use the remaining $5 on the gift certificate towards Miranda's tip so I gave the rest in cash.

That aside, o-m-g. For a doctor of this sort, Dr. Cyr is AMAZING. I have been to many women gynos (sorry, no dudes up in my lady-business) and I've had good ones and I've had atrocious ones.

My atrocious experiences have all been in Phoenix, so I had been without an ob-gyn for several months until a co-worker recommended Dr. Cyr. Lucky for me, I struck GOLD! Dr. Cyr, you're not allowed to retire. Sorry. (Don't worry, she's young; she won't retire anytime soon).

Cut to the chase. Reasons why Dr. Cyr is amazing:

1) She doesn't make me feel like a creepy weirdo for not being married nor wanting kids anytime soon. SERIOUSLY, I got grief from ob-gyns for 'not being ready for a family yet.' Um, guys, I can't even feed myself on a regular basis, and you want me to have a kid? Major fail. Dr. Cyr DOES NOT DO THIS. She didn't even bring up me wanting kids now or in the future. Thanks, Dr. Cyr!

2) I didn't wait a million hours to see her! At my last gyno doctor (who shall remain nameless), I waited 2 hours for my appt. Wtf?? Here, I waited no more than 20 minutes, and that was because I was filling out paperwork. YAY!

3) Dr. Cyr answered my questions professionally and fully. She didn't shirk around my more... awkward... questions, and she explained the options to me in plain English. She reassured me on some things that I was worried about, and she even made me laugh in the process. I NEVER laugh at the doctors! This is amazing!!

On a less quantifiable basis, I felt Dr. Cyr just 'got' me. It's hard to explain, but I felt comfortable talking to her and felt I could bring any issue up and she wouldn't judge me for it. 

Shoot, I think I want to have a baby with Dr. Cyr now. Wait.. that's not quite what I meant... anyway, go see Dr. Cyr if you have lady-parts! You won't regret it!",review,1,YgucNL2tibnjEmDLqHPqow

Though every truffle I've had the pleasure of sampling induced the ""eyes closed, head tilted smile"", there are a few that hold a special place in my heart (and stomach).

1. The Walnut Square - Available in both a truffle and a candy bar, this dark chocolate coated chunk of heaven (butter caramel and English walnuts) haunts my reverie 2-3 times a week. The only problem with the bar is that you have to bite into it, meaning there are opportune moments to drool while eating. Embarrassing? Yes. Worth it? Yes.
2. Key Lime Truffle - A totally unique, decadent delight, this creamy cube of white chocolate houses a key lime cream flavored center. It's tangy, sweet, and addictive.
3. Kona Mocha - The perfect blend of texture and flavor, toasted coconut and white chocolate surround a coffee and milk chocolate truffle. If there was a coffee that tasted like this, my mornings would rock.
4. Almond Truffle - Somewhat reminiscent of an inside-out sushi roll, the roasted almonds coat the outside, followed by white chocolate, and finally smooth milk chocolate in the center. They don't really look like truffles, which makes it easy to eat, oh, say, 10 of them at a time.
5. Chelsea - The ultimate classy truffle, pecans and chocolate liquor surrounded by milk chocolate create a mini-explosion of awesome on your taste buds. 
6. Scotchmallow - Available in a bar and a truffle, a layer of marshmallow and flavorful caramel are enveloped in dark chocolate. If I could put this between graham crackers I'd be a) in s'mores heaven, and b) a total glutton.
7. Dark Almonds - Technically this is just a dark almond cluster, but I'll be damned if it's not the best almond cluster I've ever had. 
8. Dark Chocolate Truffle - A pure, smooth chocolate with a bit of texture, this semisweet chocolate truffle and chocolate liquor center is topped with nut crunch. It's simple, but perfect.
9/10. Mocha/Bordeaux - Both of these truffles are covered in chocolate sprinkles, which I usually hate, but for some reason, they taste amazing. The Bordeaux is a pure chocolate flavor with a hint of brown sugar, and the Mocha is chocolate-coffee (obviously) available in both milk and dark flavors.

Traveling back through my childhood by writing about these exceptional chocolates has made me realize something: these are some of the best truffles I've ever had, local or not. The price is fair (maybe too fair), the quality is evident, and the selection is grand. In fact, I'd pick these over $4.00 French truffles at a shmancy-pants chocolatier any day.",review,2,BjwXX-sChcjx2E55B_7rXg

They have huge fundraising boxes of chocolate that are well-priced and reasonable for your organization or cause. Also, if you are just one person that wants an enormous amount of chocolate but does not wish to be judged harshly, pick up a fundraiser box and tell 'em it's for the kids.

Probably not much. But, because you adore me, I'm going to throw in my opinion anyway. You're welcome.

I first encountered China Chili while it was still operating at it's doomed Central Avenue location. Of course it wasn't doomed due to bad food, lousy service or any other detriment other than the light rail project's existence. So, it moved. 

After about 9 months it's back and ready to serve some of the best Chinese food in town. I've yet to venture to the part of the menu that offers duck, but I've tried several beef, chicken and pork dishes and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy. 

The dining room is wide open. No booths. All tables. The volume can get a little loud when there are many patrons, and there usually... there are many patrons.  

One thing that sets them apart from other Chinese places I've tried is the way that some of the chicken dishes are prepared. Typically, little bites of chicken are battered, fried and covered in sauce. At China Chili, the entire cut of chicken is battered, THEN sliced and covered in sauce. This makes it visually more appealing and you aren't consuming so much batter and grease.

Our first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken.  The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy.  The orange sauce was amazing.  It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there.  We still order this every time.  The lemon chicken is nice.  A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken.  Another good bet.

Since then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Holy Crap!

The restaurant I am referring to was a little place called ""Silver Dragon"" south of Dunlap on 19th Ave.  It was the Cheers of Chinese... I walked in and everybody knew me, and immediatley started to make my meal (they would double or triple it, if I had company).  My favorite dish, was called Singapore Rice Noodle.... obviously a rice noodle dish that included stir fried spare ribs, chicken, shrimp, green and yellow onions tossed with a non-spicy curry sauce.

When they closed, I was in a state of depression for nearly two years!!  Until last night, when I happened upon China Chili, not my first visit, but my first SIT DOWN experience with the restuarant.  I do what I have done at every chinese restaurant since Silver Dragon... I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered ""Singapore Rice Noodle"".  Much to the delight of my stomach, they did and it was EXACTLY the same as I remember it at Silver Dragon.

I must have put off this review for weeks as I enjoyed dish after dish of their delicious beef fried rice and spicy eggplant.  The only thing that changed my mind and why I've decided to share this hidden gem is because they can handle the volume.  Even on a Friday night where they had over 100 people in their sitting area, I called for a take out order and they said 15 minutes!  Every other time I call it  is usually 10 minutes, but to be totally slammed and only have the wait go up 5 minutes is amazing. 

So here are the dishes as I love em:
- Beef fried rice, no peas, no carrots.  I swear I could eat a whole order by myself, but my thighs would hate me in the morning.  
- Spicy eggplant...perfect mixture of tangy and spicy.  Fell in love the first time I got it.
- Honey walnut shrimp.  Very good.

I've tried various other dishes, had family over from Hong Kong and everyone can vouch for the authenticity of the taste.  Do not hesitate about this place.

Once to place my order over the phone- she remembered speaking with me, gave me updated prices before committing to the order (which were within the range she had quoted) and assured me everything would be ready on my pick-up date, provided I pay in a timely manner.  I preferred to use cash, so I stopped by to settle the bill that weekend.  Huge shop plus: Shop Cat!  This black and white sweet little thing stole my heart and the florist had her eye on me to make sure I didn't steal him.  He sat on my shoulder as I paid my bill, and I reluctantly returned him to a nearby stool.  My third encounter was when I picked up the flowers, ready right on time as promised.  I had a ton of carnations, some green trix, buplerum, and a few hydrangeas.  Shop Cat again proved to be the highlight of the experience, but the service was great as well.  She sold me a stem-ripper (to remove thorns and leaves) even though I hadn't purchased the roses from her.  

All of the flowers held up marvelously, with the exception of a few user-error calamities.  We trimmed and arranged everything in my centerpieces with a little water, and stashed them in a cool (but not cold) spare room so they would wake up.  The next morning, we used plant food in the water to top off the water levels.  Day 3 was go time, and they all looked perfect - healthy, full, colorful, and beautiful.

My favorite section has to be the area organized by famous directors and cult selections.  I admit I have splurged on a few David Lynch and John Waters marathons thanks to Movies on Central.

My only gripe is the time limit on rentals (two days on new releases) and they close early (10 pm during the week).  But it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

My standards for movies rental places have always been Vidiots in Santa Monica or Old Bank DVD in downtown LA, but this place has etched a new spot on that list. Since moving back to Phoenix, I tend to get movies from the Burton Barr branch of the Phoenix Public Library downtown. I know it's a public library, but it actually has an awesome and extensive collection of foreign films and just about a every title from the Criterion Collection you can feast your cineaste eyeballs on. 

Anyway, I was browsing the foreign section and was pretty impressed. It wasn't the usual, pitiful selection most rental places usually have that pretty much is made up of The Seventh Seal, Seven Samurai, maybe a French title, and an overload of pre-Loaded Weapon 4 Jet Li martial arts films. No, sir. While it's not as big as the stock at the downtown library, it's still pretty good and they have alot of recent films.

What sold me was when I was wandering around the store. I came across something that I normally haven't found in any video store: Russ Meyer films. If you have never seen ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"", I suggest you scrap any plans you have tonight, break up with your significant other if necessary, go here, and rent it immediately. Buying a copy of a Russ Meyer films is ludicrous process that is both arduous and expensive, but you can just go in here and rent them.

Along with that, you can find just about any cult film you're looking for and probably find titles you've never heard of or seen, like I did. There's literally a whole wall that's just labeled ""CULT FILMS"". I dropped in here last night for the first time and rented a copy of Russ Meyer's ""Vixen"" and a title that I had seen in Amoeba but never watched called ""A Boy and His Dog"". It's a film about Don Johnson (yes, of Miami Vice) surviving in a post-apocalyptic world with his telepathic dog and fighting off a cult of underground humans led by Jason Robards in clown, drag make-up. Need I say more?

If you're looking for a hard-to-find title, or even a popular one, drop in here and keep this place alive. When you have an itch for a film right away that can't wait for Netflix, as I do on regular occasions, this spot will be sure to please.

If you have any taste in film, I repeat.... GO HERE TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!",review,1,FxxYCRPcpd__yhRRmmtyMQ

Selection is solid - but keeping in mind it's used music - what's hard to find is still hard to find.  Dennis told me he coulnd't keep Leonard Cohen or Tom Waits in stock no matter how much he brought in.

The friendly staff member brought me to where all the various Christmas music was. There was seriously anything and everything.... from beginning, intermediate, and advance... to Lorie Line holidays... to even John Denver Christmas!

Yes, they may only sell comics and toys but they do that better than anyone else. It's about quality not quantity.  He asked how they stay in business when there are so many comic stores in the valley.  The truth is the other stores are garbage. Read on

(1)  They don't pilfer through the comics before putting them on the shelves. The owner even unloads the comics from the boxes right in front of you and lays them out on a glass table. So if you are guy who is trying to acquire that CGI 10.0, you will have a chance at this store. At Atomic Comics and the other stores, they go through the comics before the store opens and selectively remove the comics in the very best condition for their employees.

(2) They leave the comics on the shelves longer. They are not greedy. They don't pull a comic off a shelf and mark it up a $1-$2 a week to two weeks later. They only do this if a comic is ridiculously hot which is rare. It's nice to know that you can find a comic a month after it arrived on the market selling at cover price. There is not another comic store in Phoenix that does this. Take my word for it. I've been to everyone and they pull them off the shelves quickly

(3) They don't stuff their shelves and the comics are in great condition. I have been to every comics store in the valley and AABC is the only store in which the comics are consistently in great conditions on the shelves. You will not see bent corners. You won't see shelves being overly stuffed so that the first few issues and the last few issues in a stack are damaged. 

(4) Inventory- If its not at AABC, I go to the internet because it's not going to be at any other store in the valley.  I have too many stories of walking into other comic stores and requesting an issue and they are out or don't have it only to find 2 or 3 copies at AABC.

(5) Sales: there is not another store in the valley that gives you 25% of everything in the store on Jan 1st and July 4th every year.  That includes the high priced collectors items like Incredible Hulk 181. They also have a graphic novel punch card much like a Subways sandwhich card. 

(6) Service: It has a mom and pop feel so you get to know the actual owners of the store. The employees actually work and are helpful if you ask questions. They are not just standing around chatting with each other like you find at Atomic Comics.  They are also humble and are not condescending. This is a great place for collectors and readers of all experience. They are also not pushy. They don't push any comics on people. I love how you can stare at comics for 45 min  in peace without someone hassling you or making you feel guilty.  They will help if you need it but they will leave you alone. 

(7) Ambience: I feel like I'm walking into a Comic store not a Nine Inch Nails museum.  It's colorful, clean, organized and easy to navigate. it doesn't look like some cheap strip mall store like Heroes or god forbid Stalking Moon in which it seems like some Geek bough a collection on Ebay and decided to pay rent next to some Chinese buffet and open a comics store.

(8) JUST COMICS: This is exactly why I come here.  I was at Atomic Comics in Chandler and I couldn't even check out some comics because the shelf was being blocked by a card table.

(9) Clientele:  Look, I'm not a typical comic collectors. I don't wear tight black shirts,  I have no facial hair or piercings, I'm not up to date on all the independent ""alternative"" comics, I love Marvel and DC. I can't stand ""Goth."" Yeah,  I'm a regular guy who also happens to like comics. If you are one of these people, you will feel comfortable here.  If you haven't read comics in ages and just wanna check out the scene,  this is your place  

(10) KNOWLEDGE: The employees are educated about comics but are not pretentious. Phil is a comics' genius but he isn't intimidating. Eddie is very up-to-date on all the latest indie stuff but he will tell you honestly what he thinks about an issue and if a series is worth collecting. No pushy sales people

To show that I'm not the owner and to be fair, I do think their prices can be steep and I don't always think their older items are accurately described. I also think they can charge too much for variant issues when they first arrive. Their toy prices are pretty fair and you can get steals in this",review,2,GkWuTgewni9bzPM4HUCO-g

What makes a great comic book store? When the people working there aren't a bunch of dicks that ignore you and treat every request like your a friggin' moron. It's when you feel at home browsing around for an hour or more without feeling like your being pushed out or the staff keeps haunting you. I love how I can walk in and ask for the back selection and they bring it out for me. They didn't immediately have what I was looking for (Vault Of Horror comics) but the guy at front went in the back and brought out exactly what I was looking for and put them in nice clear wrapping with card backing and priced them right there for me. No originals, just reprints but who am I to complain? I just want to read the damn thing. Lots of back stock and a nice collection of Creepy and Eerie comics. 

Very nice selection of collectibles and busts of superheroes. The store is nice and clean and carefully arranged. Silver Age, EC, DC, Marvel, if your looking for it then you should check here first.

At that point I called McDonald and placed the order.  The florist called me later that day saying that the hospital refused delivery since my friend was in ICU, but they would keep checking back, as if she was moved to a recovery room, they could make the delivery.

They were unable to make the delivery for a week and a half, but the florist kept me up to date every few days.

Last year I adopted an elderly dog from a rescue society. Her name is Isabelle. Who ever had her before took terrible care of her teeth. She needed a dental specialist and very costly surgery. The rescue organization paid for her to receive the costly treatment and she has been a wonderful pet and companion to our three year old. We brush her remaining teeth every day. But she is old.

I called our regular vet to get her teeth checked as it is National pet dental health month and usually they are greater savings during this month. (my husband's job and the housing market has caused me to be hard pressed to spend too much money on vet bills). The price they wanted was almost a house payment and the poor dog only has seven teeth left!

I decided to try East Maryland. They were wonderful to poor sweet Isabelle. She got a free exam to let us know what it may cost. They checked out her heart, gave her a blood test, extracted four more teeth and shined up the lonely remaining three teeth. It was half the cost of the other vet. Not that the cost was the main factor, but it was a huge help. Dr. Schroeder is very skilled and compassionate. Isabelle's breed is difficult to operate on and given her age and tiny size, it was extra risky. They took every precaution to make sure she was stable. They were so good to our old girl. The techs treated her with kit gloves. They even trimmed her toenails while she was asleep. The next morning they called to see how she was doing.

She has recovered beautifully. It is less that a week and she tried to steel a chew stick from our younger dog. She is bright eyed and bushy tailed and we have a new veterinarian that we love!

Except that nobody seems to know my name there in spite of how frequently I come. But then, I'm not part of the 30-something clientle who sets up shop at the bar.

I roll into a booth or a high table that has the best view of the games that are on. It's a great place to come down and see local sports or tie one on after a terrible local sports performance. Not great because of the televisions or presentation of the games in any way(which is just two smaller flat screen TVs with no sound in the main room), but because of the laid-back, true-to-its-locale atmosphere it emits. It just seems perfectly in place and makes it feel natural  to hang out and throw some back more then any other bar around town that tries to force its motif into a Phoenix landscape it just doesn't jive with.

And of course the food and beverage there don't hurt its cause at all. I do agree with some people's sentiments about particular beers not being up to snuff compared to other breweries. My particular complaint is with their Pale Ale, which tastes like an IPA, and their IPA, which tastes like a medicinal strength IPA. But in spite of some quibbles with the beers here, they really do have some fantastic stuff. For some reason, the beer that is my standby there is the Light Rail Cream Ale, which is in stark contrast to the Brown and Amber Ales I typically get at other breweries. Its got that perfect taste/refreshment balance that acts as a Siren's call to bring me back here at least once a week.

The burgers, salads, and pizza's are also fantastic. But the real find here is the bread pudding, which has got to be one of the best bread pudding's in existence. I always try to eat slow to make room for it. Luckily, this is a place that won't care how long you cement yourself to a seat.

Which again, makes this place perfect for some Suns action or whatever is going on. But I probably remember my trips here best after catastrophic defeats. Last year after the Sun's officially bowed out of the playoffs without a championship for yet another season, and with my brother after ASU (he's an alum) lost to Oregon are the first that come to mind. The classic rock and the atmosphere and the beer (don't forget the beer) seem to breath new life into me during such trying circumstances. I guess just by being a pillar of originality in the desert.",review,3,eBFm-lABQiKpaUcPDfYOgA

That's why this classy little beauty less than a mile away from our house was a definite must-try. Let me begin the review by letting you know, up front, that we really enjoyed everything about the place. Minimal complaints! 

We visited Sonora on a Friday at around 7:00...there were a few parking spots left in what is really a very ample parking lot for downtown Phoenix. I mean, damn! There must be at least 20 spaces. I'm a worrier and I stress out about things like, ""WHERE WILL WE PARK?!"" before I go anywhere. I know...I know. So, I was pleased to see that I needn't have gifted myself with an ulcer over where we could park without getting towed or ending up on blocks. 

Sonora Brewhouse is comprised of two buildings, joined by an outside dining area between them. The building you first walk into, (the older building, I perhaps incorrectly surmised), is small and was filled with many jovial patrons on our visit. We wouldn't have wanted to sit at the bar, but we couldn't have, anyway! It was completely full, as were almost all of the booths and tables. We made our way to the outside seating area, and were about to sit down when we noticed the second building...right on the other side of the outdoor seating. We ventured in, and it was much less full than the other building, but several times as noisy. Oh, well. We sat down and surveyed our new environs. 

I've read several reviews on here vaguely bashing the ambiance of the restaurant - I found nothing to complain about. Then again, I like faux exposed-brick walls and dark wood paneling. ""Duly noted."" Alright, cool. Thanks. I also liked the kind of fun, amateurish canvas paintings of the images they pair with each of their beers that are strewn about said exposed-brick walls. Plasma TVs abound, which I hate, but I know people eat that technology crap up so I guess it's worth mentioning. 

Our waitress was just friendly enough, avoided all bitchiness, and was on top of things without being obnoxious. In other words, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the pale ale, (I think it's called The Stinger? Something like that?), and I, not a beer drinker in the slightest, decided to throw caution and personal preference to the wind and have a Vanilla Porter. Because, you know. It would taste like vanilla. And...vanilla is for girls. Like me. That don't drink beer. My boyfriend chuckled at this logic, and told me I wouldn't like it and that I didn't know what I was ordering. 

... 

Yep. Just about right. As far as beer goes, I did like the kind of bitter and still beer-like hint of baked goods flavor, but it was not anything like I cluelessly imagined. I still drank it! My boyfriend really enjoyed his pale ale with no criticisms. 

My boyfriend ordered the Tavern Steak with steamed vegetables and steak fries, and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with the kettle chips/chipotle ketchup. We were both very pleased with our entrees...the jalapeno butter (?) on the steak is pretty tasty. As for the sandwich, I'll eat anything if it is slathered in guacamole. The steak fries were as good as steak fries ever are, and the kettle chips are as good as all of the other reviews have told you. I don't eat potato chips and I hate ketchup, but I loved the combination here. Fun tip: I tried putting some of the chipotle ketchup on my sandwich, and it tasted really gross. Maybe limit your use of the ketchup to its intended, menu-endorsed purpose. 

When we were done, we had no problem getting the bill, paying the bill, and getting out. The parking lot was completely full when we left, and there were two cars jockeying for our spot. That was probably around 8:00 - 8:30 PM, so if you're a damaged individual like me who finds cause to stress about parking, go earlier than that. 

There were a lot of other options on the menu that sounded like they might be on the ""delicious"" side. If you are like us, and not into the drama-filled 20-something bar scene downtown, this might be a nice alternative. It's so close, and we were both really down with the experience...we will definitely be back.",review,5,rszuPsjf9vOpcqL_t2-L2g

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said ""If you have $250, we can go somewhere together."" And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, ""Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible."" I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her.

Pretty soon my Combo arrived, & everything was really delicious!  The Chile Relleno was zingy without being too hot, & the refried beans were extra good, too.  The portions were generous, & on top of that I received a huge, hot flour tortilla rolled up in aluminum in foil.  (They don't let you leave this place hungry!)

I debated between 4 and 5 stars.  I decided on 5, and I will tell you why!

FOOD gets the 5 stars- a rating for ""Old School Mexican Food""; not for Elements or Kai.  In the genre of budget-priced Mexican food, it's a 5 star.

The food is SOOOO good!  It is that old school Sonoran style type of Mexican I remember from when I was a kid in Phoenix (60's-70's).  It is simple, generous servings but not monstrously so.  

The staff are long-term, get to know you types.  They work hard, and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything; even when you pay, they'll take your group's bill and allow you to pay one at a time, so no dealing with a split check a the table.  This is good for groups going out for lunch from work.

In the early 90's there original location was on 16th St- TINY... and they were renown for their burros.  They are still a mainstay today and if you aren't certain of what to order, get a burrito.  Their tortas are also exceptional.  I am partial to the basic combo plates.

The drawbacks:  and yes, there are some-  

TIME.  I would go more often, but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent.  Even when we arrive early (for lunch), there can be delays.  I shouldn't be gone for more than an hour for lunch, and have been 90 minutes twice when out at Juan's.  For me, this is a problem.  And even though i really like the wait-staff, i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups.  Maybe understaffed?  I don't know for sure, but it's worth mentioning.

CHIPS.  I like the chips and hot sauce, but don't LOVE them.  They are the old school variety, which are OK but I do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa, and that's not what you'll get here.  You will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips. 

If you  haven't tried Juan's, and you don't have an inflexible schedule, DEFINITELY give them a try.  Order an old favorite, and see if you like how they prepare it.",review,2,ngD5RF07pxwlq4euexSluA

Now if it's a torta you want, there's no substitute for Los Reyes de la Torta, but for a regular Mexican menu, I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Here are a few points from my experience today:

*  Super comfortable atmosphere due to window free dining room with just-right lighting & acoustics!  Yes, the place is busy...  Yes, there are lots of kids.  No, nothing will interfere with your comfort, especially in any one of the booths lining both available walls.  The ""vibe"" is just perfect here!

*  Their extensive, easy to understand menu gives you plenty of Combination choices, & at low prices!

*  The chips are terrific, & the delicious salsa is just hot enough.  ... And yes, they're free!  (Yes, some Mexican places are charging for chips now!  Can you imagine?)

*  I have been waited on by ""Crystal"" both times that I've been here, & received extra friendly, ""just right"" service!

It was DELICIOUS.  I can honestly say I can't wait to order it again.

When we called, we were given a time an hour and a half later to come pick it up.  This is not the place to go if you are in a hurry.  I'm pretty into the whole Slow Food thing, so I don't mind waiting.  I know that good food takes time.  Hell, Chicago-style pizza should take at least 45 minutes, if it's done right.  If you know it's going to take awhile, it's easy to mentally prepare for it.  Now, if I was absolutely starving and went to this place not knowing about the notorious wait...then I might have a problem.

I liked what I saw when we went to pick it up.. the interior is cozy and fun.  The patio was hoppin', and they have an outdoor bar.

I didn't quite get my wish, as we decided on dinner rather than lunch, and at that point it was even too cold to sit outside for this Michigander.  But all that melted away as we ordered the Picasso.  A finer, tastier deep dish pizza you will never have.  Not Chicago, not anywhere. Yes it takes 45 minutes, but we were surrounded with fantastic company and drinking delicious beers, so the wait flew by.

Look, I LOVE my Italian food, and I certainly like visiting the Old Spaghetti Factory as well as Babbo's on occasion, but even these places leave me thinking that their price is a bit inflated.  It left me wondering whether or not there was a ""cheap pasta place"" out there--a joint that would serve up a decent noodles and sauce for a price that I would expect for noodles and sauce.

During our lengthy stay in PDX one of The Nines Portland (Starwood Hotel) concierge encouraged us as a must try to visit this particular Oregano's Pizza Bistro. He said the pepperoni thin pizza, rigatoni and salad were his very favorite.

On our first Sunday evening in Phoenix, we make it priority to have dinner here. He did warn us that it's a very busy place.  So we arrived after 8pm and coincidentally parked right in front of the ""welcome"" sign. Again the parking gods were looking after us. If's most unusual for us to be offered water while waiting outdoors for our table. As it turns out we eventually get seated outdoor at a bar table for two. This is where we meet our server Lucas along with his manager Jonny (yes, it's not a misspelling).

Told them that our PDX hotel concierge had been touting about their entrees. We proceeded to order the following mindful that we're intentionally over ordering and that the servings are huge in portions:

- Jr Pablo Picasso Salad
- Big Rig Pasta adding two meatballs to this rigatoni dish
- Numero One-0 12"" thin crust pizza

I think we had to be careful not to attempt to finish everything that was in front of us. It was all very very good. As a welcome to Phoenix gesture, Jonny treated us to their Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with chocolate mint Ice cream. By the time we were ready to hit the bed, it was very close to closing time.

Note:  The pizza didn't make it past bedtime.  In the meanwhile it was salad and Big Rig for lunch the next day.  My classmates keep looking me as if I was a meal on wheels.

OTHER TRIP

Didn't know that our class would run so late that it eliminated many of our restaurants we had listed that closed at 8pm and 9pm.  Intentionally we keep a number of them along the 16th Street corridor.

So Yu-go chauffeur says let's go back to Oregano's and say hi to Jonny and Lucas.  This time we're seated indoors where its quite cool with all the red and green.  Asked Jonny to recommend something other than what we had tried previously.  This time we're more conscious of portions.

- Junior sized Beefstro Salad that's spicy
- Clark Street Meat 12"" thin crust pizza
- Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with two different flavors of ice cream (told Jonny that we would buy our dessert this time. He still comped us)

When it was all said and done, there was nothing to take back to the hotel.

MANGA TALE

The pizza crust is flat bread thin and crispy so that we didn't feel like we were filling up with pizza dough.. Perhaps I would instruct them to cook it for a few seconds longer just to ensure that the crust remained crispy throughout our eating experience. Our personal preference would be the Clark Street Meat and Big Rig Pasta.  Both salads finished tied.

Have you ever known someone who is at a place emotionally where if it gets any worse, they are probably going to have to be hospitalized for their own safety.  Friendship is a place to go before it gets to the point.  They offer in hospital treatment  where a person can still go home at night.  Transportation is not a problem if you are at a place where you don't drive, or don't drive.  Meals are also provided.  And, while, Friendship is a not program for detox, but if you are clean and want to stay that way they can work with you,  A dual diagnosis does not mean there is no hope for you at Friendship.

Friendship offers two types of treament programs.  One is a program that starts in the morning and last until the afternoon.  It is really designed for a person who just doesn't have a clue as to where to start on their recovery from mental illness, or someone who functions but never has had a chance to actually learn how to do it.  For people who are higher functioning, there is an afternoon program that really focuses on the processes you have already learned and how to use them more successfully.

I am not going to begin to say what you do is easy at Friendship.  It requires work on the part of the individual.  What is unique about Friendship is even if you have no desire to do the work it takes to recover, they will teach you through group work that you are capable of doing it.  I am proof of the fact that it works.  An added advantage of the program is you are always welcome back.  I'd like to say that anyone who graduates from Friendship is going to handle things from there on out with no problems.  That is never the case. There will always be problems.  If at some time in the future you recognize you are becoming overwhelmed, you can go back.

Friendship's staff is really a dedicated group that truthfully want to assist someone who is dealing with emotional or mental health issues to achieve a happier more effective life.  If that wasn't their goal I guarantee you they would not last.  From Gus who will first contact you, (I remember thinking Gus, sounds like a moron's name, before I met him-but at that point in my life, I would have thought the same of Mother Theresa) to Erika and Shawn in the front office, to the staff, everyone is there to help you regain your health.  They work with you on everything including dealing with your insurance company.  While they can't do everything for You, you will have their support along the way!

I loved the crunch and the flavor. With the soy sauce was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our orders and just get more sushi! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had sushi before liked it. 

After devouring the sushi our food came. I ordered the beef soba noodle soup with tempura. It came with chicken instead. (boo!) but the tempura was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba noodles, I usually get udon or chinese noodles. but I really liked the flavor and the fresh spniach that was wilting more and more as time went on. The slight flavor of the sliced green onions really made the dish something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(

One queen devoured the beef yakisoba noodles at once! I was able to sneak my chopsticks inbetween his bites and I got a taste. it was CRAZY yummy! each of the veggies had a great difinitive flavor and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it. 

The other queen was pleasantly surprised at the taste of his Spicy beef rice plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too spicy for my tastes, but it was still awesome. 

We then ordered a bottle of wine and a sip here and a sip there and we were all in heaven! Talking to our waitress about the Navajo sushi chef behind the sushi bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said chef never made it to our table - and it's just as well... we were in food heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in!

I for one enjoy the choices provided by unique establishments that bring delights from multiple cultures into a friendly place where you can take your friends, family, date, or wander in alone just to experience new possibilities. When you combine the tastes of two countries, Italy and Japan, you get Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. 

I have always had the friendliest service at each of my visits and delighted in bringing my family members or friends to visit and watch them enjoy the mounting possibilities of combining decisions. What nobody expects is how filling the food can get. Sometimes I'll have some sushi and try a different noodle dish than last time, and other times I'll close my eyes and point at anything on the menu - and I have yet to be disappointed. 

The Noodle Cafe's atmosphere appears cramped, but there is a lot of detail that makes it special even when it is full. I will have to admit that sometimes I have felt forgotten by the staff sometimes, however it always seems so busy and their smiles are so big that it doesn't matter. 

The standard appetizer dish given to you when you first sit down consists of several kinds of bread that take my mind off the outside world and make me realize I'm here to enjoy something tasty. The hustle of the staff and the laughs of the other patrons make me less aware that I am actually in a small strip mall in the middle of a city that usually doesn't feel like I'm around other human beings.

I loved the ambiance. I loved that the meal doesn't start out with any old bread basket, but one with a delicious roll, yummy cinnamon-sugar toast, and excellent banana bread! Definitely a shocker, coming to a noodle place, but a pleasant surprise :)

The menu is broad and eclectic, ranging from Italian linguine to curry noodles, from ramen to sushi, and an impressive and surprising selection of rice dishes.

I had asian wheat noodles with chicken (I don't remember the name of the dish), and it was very tasty! While we were there, we heard another customer telling his friend that he's tried many things on the menu, and everything has been delicious. I believe it.

14146,AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg,3,2010-05-29,2,C46mT7Pir5xpQyIAQV2jlg,5,"From the second you enter the door, it's pretty obvious that Cherryblossom isn't exactly your usual Japanese restaurant. With the works of Chagall adorning the walls right next to the iconic Japanese beckoning cat statue (aka Maneki Neko), the interior decor definitely alludes to the nature of the food served within its walls. Though firmly rooted in traditional Japanese cuisine, Cherryblossom also has select offerings from across Asia and Europe as well. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion cuisine... more like a meeting of traditions (with some exceptions, of course).

As it's name would suggest, Cherryblossom is first and foremost a noodle house. With a wide range of noodles dishes, Cherryblossom definitely does not disappoint in this category. From Japanese noodle soups to stir-fried noodles to Italian pasta, there are more than enough options to suit an array of different palettes. There's even a tofu noodle option for those trying to keep low carb or gluten-free. In addition to the many noodle dishes available, Cherryblossom also serves a wide range of other choices as well. Sushi, rice dishes, salads and assorted tempura are all on the menu to tempt your taste buds.

One of my usual go-to favorites is the Vege-Ten noodle soup. Served up in a large bowl, it's a hearty dish featuring either udon (thick wheat) or soba (thin buckwheat) noodles (I'll get either depending on my mood) in a miso soup with an assortment of vegetable tempura placed on top. Although this is usually filling enough for a complete meal unto itself (just because I'm still a big sushi lover even after going vegetarian), I'll also frequently get a vegetable roll (avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, Inari tofu, and kaiware) to accompany my hearty bowl of tastiness... But no matter what you end up ordering, I doubt that you'll be going away unsatisfied.

So a small confession... While writing this, I totally got an urge to try one of Cherryblossom's desserts. And since I'm always so full from the meals that I get there, I've never had the opportunity to try one of the pretty desserts inside the glass case. So for just you (and my tummy), I swung out to get a piece of their green tea mousse cake (something that I had been admiring the last couple of times that I had been in)... Although you may think that this cake might be something akin to a typical European chocolate mousse cake, it's most definitely an Asian-style dessert. Light with delicate and subtle flavors, this cake features a thick layer of green tea mousse sandwiched between a thin base of white cake and a layer of red bean paste on top and is served with some fresh berries alongside. Like many Asian desserts, it's not what the typical American palette would consider sweet. It's actually very much like the kinds of cakes that I grew up eating from Chinatown in LA... Maybe not everybody's cup of tea, but I found it pretty good.

So long story short... If you find yourself hungry (or even just a little peckish) in the Central Phoenix area, I would highly suggest stopping into Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",review,4,onnvR2mrzlhlPaT0fBqsrA

I'd forgotten about my one glorious trip to the Noodle Cafe until tonight, so it got my vote. (The Noodle Cafe is not forgettable - it's just that we're always trying new places so sometimes we forget to go back to places we love.)  

Just like last time there were people waiting outside and we were told it'd be 20 minutes before we got a table.  It was really only about 15, but the food is SO worth the wait.

Tonight we ordered 3 sushi rolls: the crispy California, double crispy shrimp and the caterpillar roll.  All were super tasty! I love that they roll some of their rolls (the ""crispy"" ones) in panko crumbs - you seriously have to try one.  I think we may have ordered the same rolls last time because they're just that good! 

Last time we went I enjoyed the Spicy Korean Beef dish SO MUCH that it was really difficult for me to try something new this time.  I made a last minute decision to try the TanTan-Men Ramen dish which is a ""Sichuan Style Very Spicy Noodle Soup with Minced Pork.""  I was worried about the ""very spicy"" part only because I'm not usually that tough when it comes to Asian spices.  However, since the Spicy Korean Beef had been that perfect amount of spicy - the kind that makes your lips numb but isn't painful - I decided to be brave.  I am not kidding you - this is the best Asian dish I've ever eaten!!!  Don't get me wrong, kids - it's SPICY.  My lips were numb, my tongue was tingly and my nose got a little runny.  At one point I may have told The Boy my stomach was on fire.  But I loved every minute of it!  And the best part is they gave me an enormous bowl full - so I had plenty to take home for a second round of yumminess!

The Boy has ordered the Pad Thai and Hakata Ramen - both tasty, but neither as tasty as my dishes! :) :)

I ordered togo from here and the gentleman who took my order was very through and he even gave me a free miso soup. The finer details are what matters. When I picked up my togo order, the person who took my order asked me to have a seat at a table while I waited and he offered me some water which came in a plastic cup, a lid and a straw so I could take it with me. Thoughtful. He also asked me what kind of sauce I wanted on my Grilled Salmon and packed that in there for me. He later asks me what kind of utensils I wanted in there. 

Wow, such customer service. All this I experienced in 5 minutes of being here.

From the looks of it, it looks like it may have been an Italian restaurant at some point because of the antique decor and brick walls. Usually there's Japanese posters, Japanese bamboo art, Japanese lanterns, but this place didn't have all of that, which isn't a bad thing, it's just something I noticed. I took a look around while I got my food and it looks like it's Japanese owned(+most are not) because I heard some of the sushi chefs and possibly the owner conversing in Japanese. It was fairly populated for it being 8:30PM. The place settings included a plate and a black cloth napkin rolled up with utensils inside. This is unusual for a Japanese place because most Japanese places will give you a paper napkin and a wooden chopstick that you throw away afterwards. There's also a sushi bar for those who like to eat their sushi right away. 

The Grilled Salmon itself was a bit dry, maybe a bit overcooked to my liking but it went well with my ginger sauce. I also ordered some nigri and a tuna roll which turned out to be decent as well. I would come back here again and I see why this place is such a hit. I wanted to review anything but the ramen only because I see a lot of reviews on the ramen here. Next time.

The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.

You will find a variety of bakery items to help you celebrate any occasion (or if you just need a sugar fix). Kichel, rugulach, turnovers, Mondel bread, pastries, challah, fruit bars, breads, bagels, cakes, butter cookies, muffins, eclairs, cheesecakes. There may be more, but my fingers hurt from typing.

I stopped off to sample the famous Black and White cookie at the behest of one of my colleagues at work. When I walked in, I noticed that the price of this cookie was $2.10. Seems a bit steep for a cookie, but after sampling it I can say that it was worth every penny. The texture was light and moist and the frosting on top was rich and chocolaty (The ""black"" half was, obviously). 

Cookies and cakes with edible images on the top can be ordered so you can eat the face of a loved one with little or no screaming. Cakes are available in 10 varieties with over 20 choices of filling and over 5 choices for frosting. Make an appointment to sample the variety of cakes, ensuring your next special occasion is one to remember. 

Karsh's also separates the Dairy ingredients from their non-dairy (pareve) items. How thoughtful! The staff was very friendly and helpful and I was served quickly.

I also consider this one of my sources for German meal ingredients. They have the authentic weisswursts I grew up on, and they sell cans of kraut and rotkohl if you don't want to make 'em from scratch.

Fortunately, The Rhythm Room needn't worry about quashing the entertainment value of one of their nationally touring acts.  And the RR really does get some of the best independent acts on tour.  For artists worthy of smallish venues, this place should be as legendary as the Whiskey in Hollywood, but unfortunately, its located on, like the kiddie ride portion of Los Angeles, central Phoenix.

For a venue, they have really smokin deals on alcohol, like PBR for $2.50.  Considering that you couldn't get that deal ANYWHERE playing live music, i consider it a humongous bargain.  

They have a smoking patio that you can still hear the music during those 5 mins, and the venue is easy to get in and out of.

It DOES tend to get crowded once the main act is on, especially near the bar, but I've never waited more than a couple of minutes for a drink and i can always find a good view of the stage.

When acts like Bob Schneider come around, the place is ROWDY.  Indie acts like VHS or Beta and Midlake are near priceless to see in such a small joint.

I took my car into a Toyota dealership for a 30,000 mile check up and they came back with a quote of about $4000 to fix issues with my car that I didn't think even existed, plus my car was running fine! I ignored the Toyota dealership's suggestions. A few months later I drove to Utah, did some off roading and my check engine light came on a day later. I took my car into Precision Imports and they discovered that it was simply some minor alignment issues and fixed it for $45! I asked about the issues Toyota mentioned and they said they didn't find anything like that. Let's see, Toyota told me my car problems about 25,000 miles ago and my car is just fine (FYI: I have over 180,000 miles on my car).

Example two from last week. I took my car into Walmart for an oil change and to check out a slow leak in one of my tires back in February.  They say they can't find anything wrong with my tire and suggest I get a new one. I put off buying a new tire and stick with just filling it up with air about once a week.  My check engine light goes on again. I took it in to Precision Imports for my next oil change and to see if they find anything wrong with my tire. Of course they do. They found a four inch nail in the tire, patched it up and the slow leak is gone. Oh, they plugged in something that Walmart probably left unplugged too. $72 for an oil change, patched tire and to check out and fix the check engine light situation.

They do a great job (as in, I never had to repair the same thing twice), were honest (""Look, your car's falling apart. Period. The most we can do is slap some silicon on it and charge you $5 for the trouble.""), and charged a fair price.

I'm not thinking about leaving work, rather actually going HOME. Fountains in the Green, I think I love you. At the very least I want to make out with you. 

Hidden under a wild mass of green lies a unique apartment complex. The place is not new, what some might call 'historic.' The apartments are solid as hell. Not once have I been able to hear my neighbors through he walls. 

The Good: 
-A wide variety of floor plans 
-The apartments are huge 
-Office/maintenence staff rock 
-Gigantic freaking courtyards for ground level units. Really, really big 
-Utilities included (and basic cable). This saves a nice fat chunk of change during the summer 
-The surrounding neighborhood is actually quite nice. It's relaxing to take the dog on a long walk through through. 
-Did I mention a big ass courtyard? 

The Not-so-Good: 
-Due to the lush landscaping there are a fair number of roaches. Now, they spray and do a great job of it, but expect to pick at least a few dead roaches up each week. I have yet to find a live bug inside. 
-Parking for residents is kind of tight, and big trucks seem to be strategically placed to make getting around corners difficult (I'm looking at you silver Titan!) 
-If you're visiting a resident you park on the street. You can request a spot inside the grounds on an as needed basis. 

The Bad: 
-There is an evil ass striped cat that wears a pink collar. Don't be fooled by the collar, this cat is crazed and dogicidal. I've had this tabby terror stalk my enthusiastically stupid dog on more than one occasion. I'm a dog person, so I hate you, pink collared cat.

The space is exactly what it should be.  A nice, small salon.  Great colors and placement.  Notably clean!  Good selection of product without being ""in your face.""  Friendly people!

My hair was admittedly a MESS.  It's been over a year since I've really gotten my hair done by a true pro - I've been getting trims at the beauty school and great clips as needed every few months - but no one I trusted for more than a trim.  I told Terre I wanted to keep the length, and becuase of my natural curls, should probably have some layers put in.  He agreed - and went to town!  For the first time in my life, I actually felt like a supermodel when he was done.  For the first time in my life, I actually thought I was HOT!

So yes, the salon is worth 5 stars.  The quality and value is definitely there!  The ego boost is worth 10 stars!  I actually cried (happy tears)when I got home and was playing with my hair in the mirror.  Who knew I could actually love my hair?

I'm going to actually review while eating the food for the very first time. That's right, I just got home from Scott's Generation after waking up on a girlfriend's couch with a brutal hangover and a huge craving for matzo ball soup and chopped liver. I picked up a to-go order, and they're sitting in front of me right now, eagerly awaiting my noshing session.

Right now, Scott's Generation is happily sitting at 5 stars. The employee handling my to-go order was awesome and seemed amused at my hangover remedy. Despite the fact that I love challah like a brother and could eat chopped liver for breakfast lunch and dinner, my parents insist I am not of Jewish heritage. However, there's never been an official paternity test, so I'm still holding out hope. On to the food!

The soup is fantastic! Lots of chunky veggies and chicken in a very tasty broth. The matzo balls are large with good texture. I would prefer a bit more seasoning, but I won't deduct a star because for all I know I'm just an Italian schmuck who doesn't know what a true matzo ball should taste like. But yeah, seasoning is good.

Opening my bagel chips and...wtf? Is that a cinnamon raisin bagel chip! Sorry, deducting a star. Bagel chips are for soups and spreads. I don't care who you are, nobody wants a raisin in their soup. Throw them out!  Eating the chopped liver and....giving the star back! It's delicious and I haven't even mixed in any onion!  I don't think I realized how dense a half pound of chopped liver would be, I kind of wish I would have got some rye for a sandwich. Sorry, internal monologue creeping into review, I'll stop that now.

Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.

This place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.

Two days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).

I am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.

I've been coming to Sun Cyclery for about 11 years, and the products, service, and support are really unmatched.

Three weeks ago I bought a brand new Electra beach cruiser, which I am in love with. Someday man will be able to marry a bike, and then I can marry my bike, it's really that great.

What I love about Sun Cyclery, is the people there. They eat, sleep, and breathe bikes, and if they don't know about it, it probably doesn't matter. When I first started researching beach cruisers, Electra quickly rose to the top. I visited Sun, and was helped by Adam, who was great. I discussed what I wanted, and he helped steer me in the right direction. Another sign of a great place, when they don't automatically steer you towards the most expensive item, or recommend you buy things you don't need.

Moving on, after weeks of thinking, I picked up a sweet blue Electra cruiser, and what's great about Sun, is they have SOOOO many great accessories, you can totally trick out your bike, and make it yours. Best of all, you can personalize your bike, and not break the bank. For example, a bike I really wanted was around $600, and rather then buy that, I purchased a $230 bike, and just added on the coolest and best extras, which really made my bike mine. Btw, my tip to the bold, rather than buy a bike bell, pick up a cool horn, Sun has sumu wrestlers, sharks, pigs, etc. You name it, they have it.

When I went to purchase my bike, Joe had some awesome recommendations, I added on a white tires, and a white bike chain. I would have never thought of that, but once on the bike, it looked amazing! Did you know for around $15 you can buy a colored bike chain which totally accents your bike? They have every color, and they showed me this super cool neon green, which would look great too.

In closing, you will not go wrong at Sun. Places like this are truly a lost art. They really love bikes, and value customers.

Sadly, I was left to call places that were open past 6pm, and price shopped getting the work done. Getting in first thing the next day is the ONLY good thing to report about the dentist I ended up going to. So I told my mom I could not recommend the recent dentist I went to - but could ABSOLUTELY steer her toward North Mountain Dentistry!

While I did see Dr. Rosen once, most of my visits for the years I was going were with Dr. Arak.  Bob D's review was spot on - everyone is very professional and upbeat and truly seems to like being there.
Whether it was the attitude of the entire staff, the genuine caring about my mouth health, the lack of ""upselling"" and alarmist declarations of the work I ""need"" - or the ready availability of nitrous (I am a whimp!), the several years I was a patient at North Mountain was the only time in my life I really did go to the dentist twice a year for cleanings and checkups.

And as soon as I get insurance again, I will be back!",review,1,45V7-1r79DEG0HbuaKYIlg

this is a vegetarian joint

I am a pizza snob to the core. King Solomon's has been hit or miss in the past as it has changed ownership a couple of times. I wanted to revisit today before writing a review. I ordered the lunch special- two slices and a drink for $5.99. The slices are AZ size as opposed to NY size. This is just fine by me- two slices fill me up nicely. The sauce is generous and flavorful. There was just a little too much cheese for me, which means it's light on the cheese for your average Zonie. The crust is thin and crisp.

Some years I had not taken it in,because I was traveling an incredible amount of time for work. So I had a cleaning service come in. Which they used their own vacuum.
Last year I took it in and they kept it for 2 days and when I went to pick it up they had not changed the bag even..Hmmm,that makes me wonder if they did anything.

For a time they used to serve an excellent brunch on the weekends (Hangover cure #9 was my favorite) but that was short lived and deeply missed.

One thing to keep in mind when planning to eat her is that the menu is always changing with th seasons. It is also not traditional French cuisine, but French influenced takes on whatever fresh ingredients are available at the time. 

Some of my favorite dishes in the past have included an excellent spinach salad with wasabi dressing, a Pork Tenderloin that was tender enough to cut with the edge of my fork, and the often reviewed lobster.

But the thing that keeps me coming back is the desserts. The tartes here are made fresh every day in the morning, and AMAZING. The Banana Brulee tarte is by far one of my favorites; with the filling texture soft and creamy but not overly sweet. The crust has always been light, flaky and a perfect contrast to the filling.

This is a great romantic place to go, small but not crowded and lit nicely. I do recommend a reservation unless you are stopping by for just dessert after a dinner elsewhere, as it can be very busy with only approx. 15 tables maximum.

The chocolate and caramel fleur de sel tart is a testament to the aphrodisiac quality of fine food, and it had me moaning at the table heedless of surrounding company, who conveniently were also moaning with pleasure after sampling the four berry tart with vanilla gelato, so at least I was in good company. 

The small converted house lends a homey, romantic feel with wood floors, soft curtained windows for natural light and warm walls that were decorated with a discerning eye for color.  The tables are small and a bit crowded, but are not close enough that you will end up distracted by surrounding conversation.  It is most assuredly not a place to bring a large group of people, with a count of four being about the max for a comfortably seated party.

One thing I adore is that it's BYOB, which is a blessing because their menu is pricey enough as it is without tacking on the inevitable, exorbitant price of alcohol.  Instead they charge a nine dollar corking fee and provide all the necessary accoutrement for opening and chilling your selection during the meal. 

The appetizers are consistently delicious.  The three onion tart in particular is the perfect balance of sweet and smoky, with the tart crust and caramelized onions playing up the sweet side, and the smoky bacon with Gruyere cheese satisfying the savory.  It is an honest to goodness coup des tarte in your mouth, as has already been discussed.  The chevre cheese and tomato appetizer and country pate plate were also rich and savory, the walnut bread with the pate being particularly notable, although they lacked the complexity of the three onion tart and seemed much more savory. 

The entrees were perhaps the weakest portion of the meal, which was surprising considering they're naturally the most expensive.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection and wasn't too fatty, and the honey, lavender, rhubarb sauce was a beautiful compliment to the meat.  The accompanying green beans and mashed potatoes fell far short of the duck though, and could have used a more creative interpretation.  The Moroccan lamb shank with Israeli couscous and chickpeas, however, was off the charts delicious!  It was fall of the bone tender and all the components of the meal were highly complimentary.  The sea bass I've had on previous visits also suffered the same fate as the duck, with an ultimately well prepared and scrumptious protein accompanied by lack luster sides. 

But ultimately it is the dessert course that is the crowing jewel of this establishment. Don't say, ""Well I never order dessert."" Or ""But I'm watching my weight.""  Believe me, you want these perfectly prepared, sweet and salty concoctions to make love to your mouth.  Every tart I have ever tasted has elicited the same sleepy smiles of contentment and pleasurable moans.  In fact, it might even be a better investment to go a nontraditional route and just skip right from the appetizers to the dessert course.  That way you can order several varieties and indulge in blissful, sugary enjoyment.",review,7,tlSSQwfHYJany7wPoTH46A

Chevre Tomato- Amazing creamy goat cheese on toast points with fab tomatoes. Very mild, even my goat-hating hubby liked it. I only wished there was just one more! The mixed greens were a simple but perfect addition to the appetizer.
Three Onion Tarte- Oh my god, foodgasm. I have got to learn how to make something vaguely similar. Sweet, savory, creamy... amazing. I could eat this all day every day until the end of time and be happy.

Duck with Rhubarb Glaze- Simply amazing. Not gamey or greasy at all, the glaze perfect. The honey had caramelized and left a delicious crust at the bottom, Oh man. The potatoes are sinfully good as always, and the green beans so fresh and crisp it took me back to days on the Farm.
Fettucine- Not a thick creamy sauce, so don't expect it. Fabulous just the same, but didn't hold the wow factor that the duck did. 
Lamb- I've had it before, and assuming nothing has changed, this is a large portion and very hearty, just fabulous, a real joy if you love lamb. The couscous and ragout is sooo good, it had the lady at the table next to me moaning. See? Foodgasm. Its real.

We then added on the interesting cheese platter, something I highly recommend doing if you have the belly for it, and describing it would take me an hour so I'll just leave you to explore that yourself ;)

We had the salted caramel/chocolate tarte and the four berry tarte. I LOVE anything containing ""salt"" ""caramel"" and/or ""chocolate"" and this had it all. Sticks to your teeth and speaks to a woman's soul. Don't be afraid of the salt, ladies... chocolate looooves salt. So does caramel. What more do you want!?
The four berry tarte was much lighter and a bit warm with wonderful vanilla bean ice cream, but it is what it is and nothing more... but hubby loved it.

I went with a party of nine. Most of our group ordered off of the Yelp Eats menu, but I mixed it up a bit and ordered off the regular menu instead (hence my review here instead of under the ""Yelp Eats"" listing).

I started with the Roquefort Salad (the house specialty) - it was just as amazing as I remembered.  My fiance was literally ""foodgasming"" over the onion tarte appetizer (and I admit, my bite of that was pretty amazing) but the perfectly dressed salad filled with organic greens, roasted apples, toasted hazelnuts, dried figs & Premier Cru Roquefort had me pretty much there myself!

The entrees at the table were pretty amazing too... I tasted the lamb (yum!) and the fettucine (delicious) - but I ordered the baby scallop appetizer with a side of spinach as my entree and I was extremely happy with my selection.  

I actually kept my mouth shut during the dessert course, but from the looks of the various tarte selections at the table and how quickly they disappeared, it's safe to say that none were too shabby.  There were no complaints at our table.

We love that Coup Des Tartes is BYOB - just a $9 corkage.  Our friends brought a Riesling from Germany, we added a Turley to the mix, and enjoyed a bottle Bordeaux as well.

The place is cozy and inviting and I love the house setting that just makes you want to let you guard down. Right near our table was a photo of a flower girl and ring bearer at a wedding, just like one you'd have hanging in the hallway at your house. Everything was beautiful, right down to the French limonade bottle used for our water at the table. 

I can also honestly say pretty much all the food is good, well at least the appetizers and desserts... we shared a lot of items and never made it to a main course. Here are the items we had (prepare for a long list):

Soup of the Day (Roasted Red Pepper)
Brie Brulee
Chevre / Tomate
Three Onion Tarte
Latte with a shot of hazelnut
Banana Brulee
Chocolate Peanut Butter Tarte

I have to say that everything was truly decadent and I wanted to eat 50 more of them. The red pepper soup was the perfect starter and had just the right amount of flavor. The three onion tarte we split and downed within probably a minute or so!! This also came with a side of lettuce with a shallot vinaigrette for an added bonus (yum). I don't like tomatoes so I have to admit I didn't really have the main part of the chevre/tomate but the cheese and bread it was on was absolutely delicious. And the brie? Yum.... oh the beautiful brie. The carmelized apples on top..mmmmmmmmm an the fruits and bread with it really topped it all off perfectly.

Just when we thought we were all done, we were told about banana brulee and chocolate peanut butter tart. How delicious were both of them. On what we thought were full stomachs, we devoured them whole while I also enjoyed a latte with a shot of hazelnut. It came with a cube of raw sugar and was placed in the most simple yet adorable coffee cup and saucer. 

In the end, the price was well worth it and the staff was amazing and kind. They gave us just the right amount of space and truly let us enjoy ourselves. The pounds my scale added to my weight afterward was well worth it. It just means salad and a run tonight :)

Thank you Coup Des Tartes. I'll definitely be back. I haven't had a chance to try lunch or dinner yet :)",review,4,7zDqr2I0-xpw9HF5Ha54cA

It was a very charming brick patio area with large shade trees, water feature, and candles and other lighting everywhere.  The unnoticeable speakers played soothing music which wasn't too loud or too faint.  Just perfect.

We ordered the 3 onion tarte for appetizer which was very delicious.  The crust was perfect and the inside wasn't overwhelming in any way.  It came on a bed of greens which had a cheesy dressing that I didn't like (a very light coating, but I don't really like that type of cheese).  I ordered the lobster and my friend the lamb shank for entree.  Both were delicious, but I would recommend the lobster and the lamb only if you really like mediterranean type food.  We got the 4 berry tarte for dessert which was excellent.  The tart crusts in general were just perfect.  

Overall, loved the atmosphere - mix of stately and quirky - and loved the food.  The owner's very nice and introduces himself to everyone and checks into everyone's evening.

We ended with a chocolate tarte, usually the desert is always my favorite. Desert was good but couldn't out do the amazing meal we had.

I cook steaks all the time on the grill. I consider myself somewhat of a student.  But, the Filet Mignon was exceptional and worth every penny of that $33.00!  We were unaware the restaurant was in a converted house.  But this only added to our intimate dinning experience.  It feels as if you are in someone's home, and the owner is cooking for you personally. Wow. Talk about great ambiance.  

The food is the real star at Coup des Tates.  We started with the Pâté de Campagne appetizer.  It's one of those standard dishes which the average french person has at least once a week for lunch.  It's served with dijon mustard, cornichons & baguette.  My french brother-in-law use to smear the Pâté on his baguette and then try to slice the thiny pickles length wise.  Very funny to watch.

As I've mentioned the Filet was delicious.  But, so was the herbed marinated Chicken Breast. How can this only be $22.00?  We finished with the Burnt Cream, the french translation of Creme Brûlée.  It was also very good.

No.

I had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium.  Upon first bite, it was pure bliss!  The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste.

By far.  Oregano's, Buffalo Wild Wings, none of them compare with the greasy, spicy, juicy perfection of Long Wong's wings.  And they've got great prices.  My family of 4 will frequently order the bucket of 72 wings, for only $32.52.  For those of you who are curious, that's only 45 cents a wing!  Every day of the week!  We love the Hot and Honey Hot in particular, but all are delicious.  Although, the BBQ and Garlic Parmesan are a little too sauce-y for me.

Some others have criticized the service; I've never had a problem.  That being said, they do seem to have a limited staff.  Every time I've gone the same man and woman have been managing the restaurant.  It does get crowded around dinner time and there isn't really a clear system of lines for those who are picking up and those who are ordering.  Also, when they're busy you may not be able to call ahead.  Superbowl Sunday the phones were constantly busy so I ended up having to go in and order there, then wait.

I recently spent 5 months on bed rest in Good Sam Hospital (a very rough pregnancy) and my husband would have to go get me Long Wong's Hot Wings just to satisfy my intense craving for them.   

What I like best about them is that they are well cooked so they aren't fatty, with big fat deposits in the chicken skin itself.  Nothing is grosser to me than biting into a chicken wing and getting a big mouthful of greasy, fatty flabby chicken skin.  YUCK.   Long Wong's wings are deep fried and come out meaty and chewy and little bit crispy.  Delicious!  Kinda like the perfectly browned skin on the Thanksgiving turkey, but covered in delicious hot wing sauce.  Someone once complained that they were similar to chicken jerky and I think that was a compliment!  The way they are cooked you can appreciate the meat and crispy skin and the sauce and you don't have to muck through a heavy breading or flabby, fatty chicken skin.  

Their $5 cheese pizza isn't bad either.  And for some odd reason their fountain Pepsi is somehow more yummy than most fountain dispensed Pepsi at other restaurants.  I don't know if they can adjust the mixture and in this case they are running a stronger Pepsi mixture?  All I know is it's better than most places.

Best dining/outing experience I have had in awhile. One can go out to a place sit, order, eat, pay and leave at just about anywhere, but where is the fun in that? Bacchanal is a one of a kind dining event that I predict will be on my frequent dining list in days to come. 

George, the owner, greeted us as soon as we walked in the door. We noticed it was especially busy, come to find out it is a woman's 90th birthday. 90! She was awesome too....side note - at 90 years old she put the whole party together - e-vites and all and roused a crowed of 75 close friends and family to party with her. She is my idol! 

We got a great table over looking the festivities, great view of the band and dance floor. We then met Taso, George's son, who took great care of us the entire night and quickly brought our first of two bottles of wine. Yadda yadda yadda.... everything was great there on out. 

I had the Souvlaki Eilian (sp) - lamb skewer with rice potato and veggies. The rest of my party had the Greek style lasagna, veal and a different lamb dish. Oh and we also started with the flaming cheese, and lemme tell you, cheese on fire is awesome! Perfectly greasy and yummy! All were awesome. Then of course came the Ouzo shots and plates for breaking... OPA! 

The band was perfectly Greek, we were graced with two different belly dancers, one of which is in the Ginus Book for flipping quarters of on her belly one by one. Don't ask, you just have to go check her out. Pretty impressive! Then we all danced.

This place actually reminds me a LOT of that place, which is great to have right in my neighborhood (not to mention right next to my favorite strip club, but that's another review).

Came here with a group of ladies on Saturday night, and we had so much fun. I mean, how many items need to be delivered to your table ON FIRE before you start having a good time?  Hint: It doesn't take many. However, our mid-twenties asses were put to shame by the biggest party animal of the night, 90 Year old Mildred. This chick was celebrating her birthday with 75 of her closest friends and was scooting around that place with a vengeance. It was incredible. According to the wonderful owners we chatted with, she E-VITED her guests.  Yes, a 90 year old woman learned how to E-VITE specifically to invite 75 friends to Bacchanal.  That may not be entirely accurate, but I wouldn't doubt it.

I had the Veal Bacchanal, Aimee H. had the lamb skewer, and our two friends had the Greek Lasagna and the Lamb Shank.  My veal was very good, but the Lamb Shank that I tried was incredible! Like fall off the bone tender. But it was huge, and I was filling up on wine and ouzo, so I was satisfied with my bites.

Really though, the experience itself is worth five stars. Yes, the food isn't inexpensive (around $15-$20 for an entree...but they have a gyro plate for $10 as well), but they could have charged $5 at the door for the entertainment alone. Belly dancers, a live band, freaking throwing plates on the ground! Obviously, the way to any girl's heart is condoned destruction of property, so they did a great job recognizing that.

Okay this is a long review, but go when they have the belly dancers and band, get the lamb and some ouzo shots, and throw some plates on the ground. If you don't have a good time, you should maybe re-evaluate your definition of ""good time"". That is all.",review,5,YzNZNgpOy9tthDnczS_ajg

Being such a nice night we had the windows rolled down and were driving by 16th street and Bethany home road.

The aroma had me and I found my self quickly changing plans and following the smell. . I found my self to TexAZ Grill.

I looked at the price first when I opened the menu and said do my self. Just about everything is over $12.

I uploaded a photo of my wifes dish with her hand over the food just to show you the portion we got. We could have both eaten off her place and been stuffed. The potatoes were to die for.

Just standing abruptly in utter fascination, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking commutes in Times Square. In the office we would chalk it up to visual overload. 

So when I walked into TEXAZ Grill and behaved similarly I laughed at myself. Opening the doors to this restaurant was unbelievable. Memorabilia from the Great State of Texas. Covers. Every. Square. Inch.  

Neon lights greeted me.  ""Texas!"" (Also neon shapes of Texas were everywhere.) An old school juke box. Beer signs galore. Guitars hanging. A giant gull head. Horns. John Wayne behind the bar. ""Happy Birthday Texas!"" The best collection of inappropriate stickers *ever*. License plates of every state covered the bar. The collection has been cultivated over 28 years by the the owner and patrons. (Tip: When you go, feel free to bring stuff in!)

Anyhoo, stuff. My eyeballs were full. Finally I made it to the bar and met Tammy. (A hoot who has worked here 18 years!) After inquiring where I was from, a peppy response, ""Well, welcome to Texas!"" (And so I fell in love with this place. Before food even factored into the equation.)

ENTREES
So the food... A tad concerned there wouldn't be a healthy option to consume I was incredibly wrong. (Plenty of non-fried options!) The ribeye steak was to die for. (Perhaps the mashed potatoes with gravy were necessary to consume. But I just had to try them!) 

The meat was prepared to the exact pinkness level requested. I can't even describe the level of food happiness that transpired that night. The meat was just so tender. I had made the mistake of noshing on the spicy hot peanuts available on the bar, as well as eating my way thru the delightfully prepared coleslaw that accompanied the meal.

Amateur hour. Yes, definitely eat the coleslaw. It was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo. (Or try the salad with the blue cheese. Wonderful chunks of cheese.) But leave space for your meal!

As I wasn't dining solo I had the opportunity to sample a burger. Holy bejeebers. This isn't a frou frou burger. This is a simply prepared burger, sans grease, on a beautiful bun with high quality meat. 

DESSERT
We earned a bread pudding! One second and I'll explain how. Tough decision as to what to pick but we went with the french bread in an egg custard with toasted pecans & raisins. Why? It was topped with a bourbon sauce! Dense and delicious. Served as described. Warm. Mmm mmm mmm! Biggest scoop of ice cream too!

TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. 

We started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. 

My son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. 

We were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. 

So the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drunk orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas.

all the denny's waitresses from down across the street come hang out after (and before?) work. they have a couple of pool tables, and this sweet-ass old-school bowling game that costs like, a quarter and is old and made of wood, which instantly makes it awesome. and it sounds awesome. 

AND! if all that wasn't enough to make this the greatest bar ever, they also have twilight zone pinball, which is THE BEST PINBALL GAME OF ALL TIME. we have won so many free games on that thing. everyone probably gets weirded out because we play pinball wizard by the who on the jukebox while we play.

except one negative. whenever monty (awesome) isn't working, some other cracked out babe works and she always closes the damn place at like 1, which is SO annoying (we're talking fridays and saturdays here--monty stays open til at least 2 even on tuesdays). and she always forgets our change and orders and everything else, really. and makes us feel like we're cracked out just by watching her.

Why is this the review that will serve as this reminder when I have so many Yelps explaining so much about that already? Well:

I went here on an anthropological adventure. I'd heard the regulars were noteworthy in a Bikinesque fashion. That they're scary and funny and local and Cheersish... And that everything takes forever. And that everything is average but that it's the combination of the preceding factors that make this place worthy of one adventure to see how the other half live in their natural habitat.

We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY, like within seconds, greeted by a drunken song. A man and a song and a twinkle in his eye and I was immediately charmed. 

I was expecting it to smell very strong, especially since they sell cigarettes in the vending machines, but really there was no noteworthy odor. 

The bartender was high or drunk. If she was not high or drunk, she's spent so much time in her life being either high or drunk that she now gives off a permadrunkenhigh vibe. For instance, she takes our drink orders and says, ""Want menus?"" and then walks away and re-asks us our order, which was a pitcher of beer. And then does not ever bring menus. Glazed eyes. I don't give a fuck ethos. 

AMF is on the menu, which I had to be reminded stands for adios mother fucker, which is just basically telling the drinker that this particular night will not be one they should bother trying to remember. Here, I could make some grand (albeit stupid) statement about how this is exactly the type of place people come to forget, but I don't think that's true considering I was the only one drinking them. 

The one gentleman we interacted with was so desperately lonely that he clung to every vestige of a chance of an opportunity to insert himself in our convo and I felt deep sympathy for him. 

All and all, I can't see any reason to ever go back but I'm glad I went and that it exists. It serves a need. It serves a population. It offers an opportunity for snobby a-holes to have a place to go on ""anthropological journeys.""

Nordstrom's Rack and Cypress Grill. 

Town and Country has stepped it up with a new expansion. They've now added to their quiver a Nordstroms Rack, Five Guys Burgers, Potbelly Sandwiches and Cafe Rio. Well Suited, their 'My Sister's Closet' men's shop, has been added, replacing My Sister's Attic, their second hand furniture store. Aside from bargain shopping at Nordstrom's rack, I do enjoy visiting Cafe Rio on Tuesdays for $1.75 tacos all day long. If that doesn't tempt you, Bianco just might. His newly re-branded Italian Restaurant Tratoria Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco might just get you to swing by.

I tip my hat to you Town and Country, I'm gonna show you some 5 star love - cause I like you so much. I used to only swing by when I needed a thing or two from Trader Joes, had a hankering for an awesome Gyros from Cypress Grill, or wanted to stare in awe of the gym rats coming out of the LA Fitness - I still want to know just how do I get my abs to look like that?

The lobster tail tacos were A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!!!  Big hunks of lobster tail (langostino) and a pinkish sauce served in huge corn tortillas.  I got the combo, which comes with a side of rice and a side of beans.  You can choose refried or black.  I love their black beans.
Another thing I love about Baja Fresh is their salsa bar.  My favorite is the baja.  It's a smoky chipotle salsa.  I always get a bunch of different salsas to take home with me.  Their green salsa changed, but it's still really good and tastes so fresh.

The special is about $17 bucks, which you easily pay for two specialty rolls.  The rules to teh special are cute too, so don't over order because you'll pay 50 cents for each piece left. :-)

I really, really like this place.  It's got a hip, yet laid back atmosphere, good rock music playing, and very genuine and friendly staff.  

Food - I've had sushi here a few times, and it was ""good"".  About 7.5/10 on my sushi scale.  But let's talk about their build to order rice bowls.  You can mix and match a myriad of meats and vegetables and choose your temperature level.  I told my server a few visits ago that I really like hot, spicy food, and she recommended the ""Exit Wound"" bowl.  The name alone is super cool.  This selection immediately became my favorite lunch dish that I've had in ages.  Quite spicy, but not over the top....and amazing flavor sauteed into the breaded shrimp, chicken and fresh vegetables, all over white or brown rice.  (brown for me)

Did I mention that the owner of this place is a beer snob?  There are always several outstanding craft brews on tap here - and they go SO well with some of the spicier dishes.  I would come to MOTO just for the beer selections, but the food is also good enough to get me back in there as well.

The sushi was really fresh and unlike several other AYCE sushi places its made when you order it so it hasn't been sitting out all day.

What in the dickens makes a good Italian Beef Sandwich? Well, it depends on who you ask to a certain extent. 

My unbiased opinion of what makes this the perfect sandwich, starts with in house, slow cooked, thinly sliced, Beef, with a blend of Italian spices and it's own natural juices. You add that to the perfect type of roll that is dipped in those juices, a slice of provolone cheese is added to the steaming beef and roll, then top it off with house made giardinara, made of Zucchini, Olives, Serrano Chilies, Carrots, and Olive Oil, and boom....There you have it! Top it off, by pouring a cup of the beef stock over the sandwich before you put your bib on and create a dam of napkins on the table for the inevitable mess that the authentic sandwich is going to create. ;) 

Note to those who get all hurt and flustered about the house made giardanara because they use Serrano chilies, they do offer the pickled giardanara as an alternative option as well. So don't shoot them down before you go and give the place a shot. 

The fries are crispy on the outside and like a mashed potato on the inside. 

The Polish, and Brat are real sausage links from their own supplier, not the crappy hotdog like sausages that you get from a hotdog stand on the street of a crappy neighborhood or from a place like Lobby's in Tempe. 

The only thing that sometimes throws off the consistent experience for me, is that at times when I ask for a side of the beef stock, it isn't stirred before they dish it up, and it has a thick layer of oil in the cup, rather than the aqueous layer beneath which contains all of the flavor. This is something that they could take as a constructive criticism at times.

The only other establishment that serves up a perfected version of this beef sandwich is the owners brother who just opened up Chicago's Taylor Street. He was the best maker of theses sandwiches at Lukes for years, and recently opened up his own spot. It's great to see some competition in this Valley, especially with a couple of brothers competing with eachother. It should help keep the standards high, which should create a good product for us.

Try out both of these spots and write an according review to spark up the competition to the two current greats in the Valley of the Sun.

The beef is wonderfully tender and juicy.  So juicy in fact they don't even serve it with au jus, but they do have it on hand if requested.  I recommend you ask for a side.  Save some for me though!

I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.

Also, I don't get pedi's though because my wife has scarred me for life by making me watch a 20/20 expose about them. Anyway...

This place was great! Everyone was very friendly and my girl kept the conversation going even though I wasn't feeling that great, so that was awesome. She was quick but thorough, which is also awesome.

She asked if I wanted my nails buffed and I said I didn't want them to be shiny. She said they wouldn't be too shiny, just look nice, then mentioned next that was it was $4 more but I sprung for it, because I was in a spending frenzy. :S They were very shiny. For a couple weeks. Not cool.

My daughter and I went in last Satuday.  I figured if I was a walk-in I would have to wait a while.  I think I only waited about 10 mins.  I was greeted warmly, told to pick out a color, and have a seat.  They were busy but what salon isn't busy on a Saturday?  They ladies seemed to have it together though.  They were all working, chatting with their cllients or amoungst themselves but I heard mostly english instead of the usual vietnamese.  My nail tech was Tracy and she was a sweetheart.  She did a great job. A needed a pedicure badly.  She made my toes look beautiful!  She even put the cutest flowers on them too.  I will ask for Tracy next time I go back.  My daughter got a peducture too.  She was a little aprehensive at first but there was another little girl her age in one of the chairs having a pedicure too so she gave it a go.  Her nail tech was very patient. with her and did a great job!  She loved it so now it will become a mother/daughter outing to get our toes polished and pretty. 

The shop was clean and everyone was nice and friendly.  More english was being spoken here then I have heard in any nail salon in a long time.  I like that.  And I appreciate that.

Picture a Strip mall....you walk in....lights turned low, red walls, dark carpet...intimate...perfect...you've forgotten about the strip mall.  

The restaurant was one of the first restaurants that I tried when I moved to AZ in 1998.  Thank you to my Aunt Marge for taking me to this little gem.  The food is what I like to call great american cuisine elevated.  PCG can, in my book call itself the most dependable dinner in the valley.  I have frequented this establishment many of times and have never had to complain about a single thing in the restaurant.....maybe when they closed for that short time back in 2000 I bitched a little.  

When a restaurant puts Mac N' Cheese on a menu...they are dying to be critiqued hard...So I use Mac N' Cheese as a measure of quality.  Mac N' Cheese is such a bad name because Kraft and Velveeta have raped it of legitamacy in the culinary world.  Now PCG makes a darn creamy rich flavorful Mac N' Cheese and that to me signifies attention to quality.  I have had bad MNC at other ""deconstructed"" restaurants but PCG doesn't stray to far from the point of the dish...and they are successful.   I also fancy the Pot Roast or the Pork Tenderloin.

Day two back from vacation: I've gotta make up the debacle from the night before to the hubby.  So, despite an inch of rain falling during the time it took us to drive from Van Buren to Bethany Home, we decided to keep going up to the Phoenix City Grille.  And I'm so glad we did.

I had been here a few times, thanks to the corporate overlords of the funeral home I worked at just up the street.  But, at the time I was a vegetarian and not astounded by the menu (embalming and meat eating just don't mix in my eyes).  Thankfully, I gave up my veggie tendencies, because the food here is incredibly delicious.

The husband loved his burger sans bun and claims that it was the best burger ever.  SCORE!  

Oh yeah, and my meal was phenomenal too.  Super juicy pan-fried chicken and horseradish mashed potatoes.  The horseradish had no kick to it, but the flavor was definitely there.  I suppose if I could offer advice to the awesome chefs at PCG, I would suggest adding a splash of horseradish on top.  But I really love that sinus-clearing sensation of good, fresh horseradish.  Regardless, the meal was fantabulous.

The tartar-sauce like dipping sauce, however, was too creamy. It took away from sweetness of the shrimp and saltiness of the bacon.

Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. 

I started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. 

For my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!

I wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic.

But I do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like, ""I don't know anything about that but let me go check with a manager"" after I showed proof. It wasn't even the appetizer but the principle of the matter.

I left a comment on the restaurant's Facebook page--very diplomatic, not with any self-entitled overtones. Their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened. Less than two days later, he wrote me, with the owner copied in, apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two! 

This update is not to say ""Woohoo! I got a free meal."" It's just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it. It also sounds like because of me, they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that. And when I did go back for my free meal, that same server was there, lol. Luckily I had another server who was a lot warmer and approachable.",review,1,ZrUZtLgLOn15v2NIZl-oKQ

As literally one of my favorite places in town one would think it would be at the top of my to do list. Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can't get my yummy sammies. 

It is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.

Duck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) ""Am I still in Phoenix?"" 

They have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... 

The Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food.

""The Duck"" is my measuring stick for every other sandwich shop and deli. 

Your first time here may be a little confusing, because your order will be taken on a paper bag and there are a lot of options. You should feel safe in the knowledge that no matter what you get you will be happy. 

My favorites are:

Traditional sandwich.... Roast Beef or Smoked Turkey on any of the breads, with mayo, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, add sprouts. 

Feeling like tuna? Alabcore tuna on toasted ciabatta, with no celery, add sprouts, with lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. The Albacore as a salad is a great option if you are not eating breads at the time (which would be tragic because all of their bread is fresh and perfect).

Uncommon... Italian Dry Salami on sourdough with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. Just do it. 

Get the tea of the day. Browse the wine and beer room, consider getting a coffee drink at some juncture, and peruse all of the knick knacks and food stuffs. They'll call your name when it is ready.

I have had just about everything on the menu. No, I HAVE had everything on the menu. 

I am partial to the swiss cheese because I have not been able to find cheese like that anywhere else, but if you like cheddar (some of  you do) then try the Longhorn- it is the same price as the swiss, any other cheese will cost you extra. If you like cheese in general, then do yourself a favor and get a cheese tray, call some friends, get some wine, and relax.

3. Side options, so many to choose from and not just the normal potato salad or pasta salad. They have those too, but sides like cottage cheese with herbs, southwestern salad, egg salad and more

4. Bread, meat, spreads and cheese selections too - I haven't tried all of them, but they all look delicious

5. The gift store... I'm always looking for a place to bring out of town visitors and this will be one of them. Its an airy building with cute items and some would be useful around the house too

Most of the older, more established places really resonate with all of us, since we've frequented them so much throughout the years....or at least that is me. For those whom aren't from here, or do not know of Duck and Decanter, all you need to know is that this is THE ONLY BROWN BAG PLACE YOU NEED TO KNOW OF. Period.

**The Layout**
As soon as you walk in, you see a number of things First you will notice the fun food items and nick-knacks on shelves, all usable and able to be purchased for use in your kitchen. Off to your left you will also see a coffee bar which is directly in front of the wine room. Each offer excellent products as well as experienced servers who can help you decide further. You also will see on the left wall a large selection of extremely high quality coffees from around the globe. Finally, to the right a large deli section with fridges filled with the same meats, cheeses, and sides you enjoyed in your sandwich

**Fud**
The food is excellent, of course. Everything used is waaaaay above the quality of normal sandwich shops. You have a wide selection of fresh made pasta options as well as soups and other various sides. Its truly up to you to make your own brown bag special. My favorite is the Sonoran Chicken, with a wheat bread blend and swiss or provolone.... You can't go wrong with anything here guys. The staff work hard and care about your experience.

**What else?!?!**
They have awesome music events planned out each week utilizing the patio out front. It is a two story building, so you can go upstairs and go up their for a group event if wanted.

ENJOY EVERYONE!!!!!!!",review,4,joEN2Mx6n2FNzsIrR0CpjQ

As a young girl, I would frequently come to D&D with my dad. We would always get sandwiches, and I would be allowed to get a prize from the toy chest (not sure if they have it anymore). It was a place where we got to spend time together and bond, which was rare because as an  OB/GYN, my dad was frequently on call and at work. 

I was pleased to recently find out that after all of these years, Duck and Decanter has not lost its honey feel, warm ambiance, and quality of their food. 

This June, I took my dad there for Father's Day lunch. The sandwiches were as good as I remember. Nothing extravagant or peculiar, just classic sandwiches. Fresh breads, crispy lettuce, vine ripened tomatoes (among other things) and yummy mayonnaise. Not to mention their meat is very high quality and fresh-- all still at the amazing quality I remember as a young girl- fantastic. 

The staff is nice, helpful and super friendly. They give the place a warm feel to it. 

While you're there, make sure to shop around a bit, as they do have quite a few little trinkets and specialty food items like hot sauces, chocolates, and jams. All of their items are fairly moderately priced as well. 

To eat, you can either go upstairs to their loft area, sit on their tucked away yet lively patio, or in the lobby area of the restaurant. All places are nice, clean, and family friendly! 

Duck and Decanter is truly a great place to get a great quality sandwich and spend some quality time with the family.",review,1,Qtro4APUHh1wEwnVhciPPQ

I especially like that you can build your own sandwich. I usually go for a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich on wheat bread. Can you say yum?! The bacon especially, since it is huge and thick - I'm pretty sure it's prosciutto, 'cause this ain't no regular bacon. I always order this sandwich and my husband always wants a bite or half the sandwich. (He usually orders the Genova sandwich.) It's definitely a sandwich you could share, but only grudgingly. 

The store itself is really nice to browse and find specialty chocolates or treats while you wait for your sandwich. I'm always tempted to buy the fancy chocolate bars - there's too many to choose from! It's nice that they carry local product and other items.

There's plenty of room to sit, whether it's upstairs or outside on the patio. The patio is fantastic, especially when there's live music. We love coming here on the weekend to sit back and relax.

I actually had a hard time finding them at first. They're located by the parking garage in the SE corner of a plaza that is on the SE corner of E Camelback Rd and N 16th St. Overwhelming amount of directional abbreviations aside, if you manage to find this gem, you will not be disappointed.

I stopped here twice during my Phoenix visit. I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch. 

On another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady. 

The food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout. Barrels of coffee beans, containers of different teas, wine, cheeses, beer, different kinds of oils, all kinds of stuff. 

There's seating all over, including outside, but I chose the upstairs loft both times. It was relaxing and there are giant photos of AZ wildlife all around upstairs too... I like animals... and free WiFi. Yup, they have free Wifi. I love you D&D!!!

Part store, part bar, part deli, part someone's living room who doesn't make you feel guilty about not helping with the dishes, only catch being you actually have to pay for your wine and cheese (which I'm totally fine with if it means I don't feel guilty for not helping with the dishes).

Basically the duck has everything you could possibly need dispersed at different locations around what appears to be a large cabin with a lush green park in front.  You get your items (wine, coffee, sandwiches, whatever) and you mosey around, find a place to sit and enjoy them, just like you would in your own backyard, except your own backyard probably doesn't have as extensive of a wine collection or an award winning cheese department (and if it does, I officially hate you).

I like to come here for happy hour (M-F, til 7:00, $2 off house wine and draft beer) or on Sunday afternoons to do a little daydrinking and people watching.  I don't have kids or a dog, but people that do seem to love this place.  Normally I don't prefer my wine with children (probably why I don't have kids), but the Duck's overall mellow environment somehow soothes me to the point that I find myself actually enjoying the presence of the mini-humans.

With copious amounts of places to sit (inside and out) it's perfect for a leisurely bite. My adventure was during a Friday happy hour. (M-F, 5-7pm. $3 drafts! $3 house wine!) Arriving early to secure an outdoor patio spot we meandered thru the space. There's live music on Fridays with a start time of ~ 6pm. 

THE BASICS
Cooking accessories, teas, coffees, spices, a wide array of imported specialty foods line the shelves. Need some meat? They've got it. Want a sweet? Yep. In the mood for a sandwich? Si. Want some cheese? Be adventurous! They have adorable tiny wedges for a buck and change. ""Try something new without fear of commitment."" Ha!

The wine / bar area, though petite in size, is lined floor to ceiling with wine bottles. Bob, the bartender on Fridays, is the friendliest gentlemen you could ever meet. The beer fridge is filled with a respectable number of bottles. 

SEATING
There's plenty of it. Two floors. My visit we were focused on nabbing seating outside near the live music. Turns out the music is fairly loud and you don't need to sit that close! You order your food inside and service your own tables here.

For noshing we nibbled on a patio cheese tray. I'm not entirely sure what cheese was served. Our platter included a small palmful of soft cheese, a jam spread, sliced bread and sliced apple. For the price point I'd actually have preferred a sandwich. But still tasty!

WINE TASTINGS
At Duck & Decanter you can arrange a private wine & beer tasting for groups of 14-24 ppl. Lasting two hours in duration the sessions include the booze (duh!), cheese, printed info and a host. Sometimes they can include additional food. It depends on headcount and budget. ($20-$35 /person + gratuity + tax). This seems like a really neat thing to set up.

Tasting menu examples...The Beer Tasting has you traveling thru six different countries. The Business Mixer offers three red and three white wines. The Blind Tasting sounds awesome! Wine is served from a brown bag and it's up to guests to pick the grape. 

So anyway, Duck & Decanter is a pretty neat experience! On the Friday I went, the outdoor space was very family friendly and multi-generational. If you're in the neighborhood check it out!",review,5,gzJpPaHN-NXBkAZcZri3hw

So, if you're from one of the cities back east with a large Polish population (like Chicago), Paczkis are pretty much a staple for Fat Tuesday.  For those of you unfamiliar, it's pretty much a filled donut, but they're really good, and made even more special because you can only ever get them 1 day a year.  

I was told on good authority that Europa is *the* place to go in the valley for real Polish fare, and it certainly didn't disappoint.  They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can't spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I'm forgetting. 

They also had a little Polish deli with more food I won't even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.   

Also, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I'm assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn't understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.  

Go forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole ""Lent"" thing, if that's the sort of thing you're into.  If not, enjoy it without having to do any of that pesky fasting.",review,7,4zinPJ38-WxjPPomn7CPAQ

Why?  Because I am a lame-ass runner.
It doesn't matter that I've been doing it for years now, I still suck.  I have no speed, little endurance and bad knees but these guys don't get down on my sudden desire to run stairs, they help me find shoes that will cushion my need to shred myself.  This is a happy thing.

On my last visit I knew they were really listening.  I am always on the look out for a good sports bra.  Being extra grande up top I am often handed the old adage 'wear two'. But my sales guy actually looked at me LOOKED and said 'telling you to wear two when you wouldn't be able to get the first one on isn't going to help.'  YES! Thank you!  So the man asked me 'what have you been doing?'  I told him what I wear so he could pass it on and it won't surprise me if when I go back there is more conventional wisdom available or maybe some new gear.

I'm always surprised at how few good specialty shops of any kind there are in Phoenix.  As far as I can tell Runner's Den is THE specialty running store in the Valley - and thank the gods its a great one.

It can be crowded on weekends, and the wait for assistance can be maddening, but it is worth it.  The only way they could afford more floor space and staff would be to broaden their focus and then they would just be another Champs or Big 5.

Want to get fitted for shoes by someone who knows what they are doing and can recommend the best shoe for you?  Maybe analyze the wear pattern on your present clogs and suggest a replacement?  Or would you prefer going to the mall, saving $15 bucks and having a pimply-faced teenager who spends most of his life on Xbox take care of you?  It's your choice!

I was a serious - meaning top 20 nationally in my age-group - multi-sport guy when I lived in SoCal, so I think I know a good running store when I see one.  And trust me, Runner's Den is LEGIT!  The folks working there are all runners and pretty serious about what they do.  Excellent selection of shoes, socks and toys for foot massage and other devices.  Things you might find at Tribal Multi-sport but otherwise nowhere else in the Valley that I know of.

I am such a noob, that I hurt my ankle while running in $30 cross trainers. A friend recommended Runner's Den so I came in for their free running injury clinic and I'm so happy I did!  The Doctor was nice and very thorough and helpful. He gave me a few stretches to do and recommended a pair of shoes that would be appropriate for me (which was the same as the Runner's Den employee suggested while I was waiting to see the doctor, so sounds like they were spot on!) This was great, because my inner hypochondriac had already convinced my brain that I'd eventually have to amputate. Turns out my prognosis isn't that grim.

All the employees I spoke with were nice, helpful and extremely knowledgeable. I know a lot of people complained about higher prices, but I looked up how much the shoes I picked up were going for online, and the prices were exactly the same on all the major websites (eastbay, amazon, footlocker, etc) so clearly I'd rather support a local business! I'm sure prices vary with the different shoes, but the one I was looking at wasn't any cheaper anywhere else which was nice.

The staff here is super nice and takes the time to evaluate your feet. I learned so much just from talking to them. For example, I should have been wearing a narrow size and my old running shoes were 1 size too small! I guess that explains why the new ones feel so much better...duh.

Staff will have you try on shoes, then actually go outside and run down the sidewalk in them! It's a little awkward to be watched while you do this, I was seriously questioning if I even knew how to run in front of this audience. Then they'll evaluate how your running looks in the shoes. I tried on two pairs before we found the perfect fit. Yes, that's two running evaluations that made me feel a little shy.

Barry Anderson was very courteous and knowledgeable about the exact type of running shoes I was looking for. He listened to what I wanted, and let me try on 3 pairs that all matched my requests. I settled for the first pair he suggested to me, and I love them! They are so comfortable to run in.

Price wise, it is fair. I am a guy with uncommon foot size and shape, and consequently, I expect to have to pay more than the average consumer. My running shoes were around $120.00 out the door. Let me tell you, between the superior customer service and my needs, I feel the price is very fair. Sure, you can definitely find a pair of simple running shoes somewhere else for cheaper; however, as is the case with many things in life, you get what you pay for. Not only are the shoes they sell high quality and durable, but further, they assign certain types of shoes to you based on a short interview on your running/foot strike habits. If you go anywhere else, you might be unknowingly buying a shoe that is hurting you or not supporting you the way it should. You can tell they care about their business and reputation, it shows with their excellent customer service.

I really wanted to get legitimate with it, and this place had been recommended a few times.  So, down I went to see what it was all about.  

I was promptly greeted by Kelly.  She asked what I was in for and I told her I had no idea what I needed, as far as shoes go.  She was up for the challenge.  I have to say, this was the most interactive shoe buying experience I've ever had. First, she had my take off my shoes and show her how I walked.  After observing my feet she went to the back and brought out several pairs of shoes.  She showed me how to properly put the shoe on and then had me go for a little jog outside of the store while she observed some more.  I ended up doing this a couple of times, each with more comfortable shoes.  I ended up with a really great pair from Brooks that I nearly fell asleep in the first night like a little kid.  I didn't feel like she was trying to push me to buy higher priced shoes, which is great! I hate feeling pressured to get the biggest/most expensive/etc. of something.

First off, when you walk into an ethnic food restaurant, and the place is filled with people of the same ethnicity, and the place is really quiet because everyone is busy enjoying their food, you know it's a good place to eat.  

Is it a bad thing when the host/manager recognizes you when you walk in... and remembers your order?  You'd think we eat there a lot or something.  I've found my favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala, medium spicy and if you like shrimp, the Shrimp Tikka Masala is just as yummy!  We usually order a side of the Paneer Kulcha (unleavened bread stuffed with Indian style cheese), which is wonderful to sop up the extra yummy sauce after you are finished.  Portion sizes don't appear to be too large, but we always have leftovers.  And it's always better the second day too!

Located on the SE corner of 16th Street and Bethany Home in the old strip mall behind Starbucks (that used to be El Pollo Asado, for you old timers), Swizzle is a find!

After a few drinks, I bought a t-shirt from here that touts, ""Swizzle Inn...Swagger Out"".  Gotta love it.

Your standard dive bar with a pool table, darts and a pot luck on Friday nights for happy hour.  The drinks are strong and cheap.  Shannon's a great bar tender!  

No food at the Swizzle, but that's ok, they'll let you bring it in.  On a few occasions, we've had pizza delivered or brought in take out from other places.

Ladies, you'll be impressed with the restroom.  It's clean and always has toilet paper, as well as a fully stocked vanity with mouthwash, hair spray, lotion, tampons, etc.  Not what you expect in the typical dive.

Why does it always take a scare to get me to do the responsible thing? Sigh. 

I called earlier on a weekday to get more information and the woman who answered was incredibly helpful. I said I was interested in an appraisal and she promptly let me know the hours the appraiser was available and how much it would cost. Given that you often have to fish for information, I highly appreciated how upfront she was. 

I ended up going into the store on a Saturday around noon and was immediately greeted by a very friendly couple, who owned the store. The woman immediately noticed how dirty my rings were and asked if she could clean them - I loved how willing she was to help before even knowing if I was going to buy something. 

The owner got me started right away by making copies of my existing diamond certificate and previous appraisal (helpful hint: make sure to bring any similar paperwork you have). Then, the appraiser came out and let me know that he could take care of the appraisal in 45 minutes. I decided to go shopping at Old Navy and come back.

The appraiser, Mark, sat with me for a good long time going through each piece.  He helped me determine which pieces were worth getting officially appraised and which were not.  I settled on getting appraisals for 4 specific rings.  Another employee kindly sized the remainder of the rings which will help with resale.  

They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The appraisals were done in about a week - great description and photos.

So, listen... it's about 11:derty am.  Still early for lunch.  No one around, see?
I walk in and the place, it don't look like no sub shop, ya know.  Looks solely like a nice little authentic Italian grocery, you get me?  I like it.  They got everything there, and my eyes are buggin outta my head like *this*, see?
I mean, I'm lookin' at this quaint package that looks like it could either have a bottle of, emm... a Sangiovese, or maybe even a nice Dolcetto for the lady types.
And, then they got these tins of all kinds of olive oils.  They got these dried salamis and a big thing like *this* of Prosciutto.  There's a nice little case there of homemade pastries that were tasty just by lookin at 'em.  Jars of authentic sauces up the wazzoo!
I dunno, what am I sayin'?!  GET OUTTA 'ERE!... they ain't got no Safeway stuff here, c'mon!  Hckck!
I just ain't seen so much authentic Italian stuff.  And the place, you know, it's 'bout as small as one-a those swanky studios downtown, and they got it packed to the chin.  But hey, I digress, look at me!

So, I looks up at the menu and I sees they got ""Italian Sub"" up there as one of their six or seven sa'mmiches.  It's nice, ya know?  So hey, anyone can claim to make an 'Italian' sub, so I gotta ask to make sure.  I ain't a fool!  Hahaha!... ok, knoggitoff, listen!...

This guy comes up to the deli case and he looks to be a nice enough gentleman.  He's got his apron on to keep himself proper, a conservative pair of prescription sunglasses that you can still see him look you politely in the eyes like you're family, and the guy even cleans his hands before he's ready to listen to what I gotta say.  Hey, that's class, and respect!  Other places don't know about that.

So, this is what I asks, I asks this right here... I says, ""What's in the Italian sub?""
Guy goes through a quick list with his fingers: ""Three meats, cheese, tomato, lettuce and dressing.""
Hey!  That's perfect!  You can't get anymore honest than that, and that's the best that I need to know.
So, ""Ok"", I says, ""I'll have one"", and he gives me a nod.

So, this guy gets to putting my sub together, and I see he's just graceful at it, like he's just pulling the elements outta thin air.  Not like those kids over there at Mr. Subways, acting all confused and empty like a clan a-mice with hats on, forced to stand two inches from one another for 8 hours!

I mean, this Niccoli guy's just effortless, putting a little a-this, a little a-that, and - DONE!

I sh*t you not, jerky, it takes this guy no more than 40 seconds to put that thing together!

I ask for a bagga chips, too.  He asks if I might want a drink, but I thank him and pass, since I got one back at work.
Nine bucks and change it costs me.  The size of this thing, though, they aren't faking 'cuz I can see this sub's an honest foot!  And, I can already smell the dressing and salami from it!

""You have a good day"", he says.
""Thanks.  You too"", I reply.

I get back to my desk, and I unwrap this thing, and it's just like the guy said: it's stacked, but not too ridiculous like.  It's holding everything nicely and naturally like.
I take my first bite, and it feels like... it feels like... I'd been reborn.  This thing is the best sub I've had since... since I been born!
It's dripping a little with the purest most wonderful olive oil I ain't tasted before, and that bread roll I tell ya, it's keeping fresh and crisp like it's just meant to be!  I can't believe it!  I had to set the thing down as I was chewing, sit back in my chair and close my eyes, and just... LIVE!  That salami, too!  And, there's provolone and ham!  It's all fresh.  And, there's even some herbs in that dressing that made me feel like an a**hole in heaven.  I ain't never been treated to a sub like that.  THAT'S Italian!

You gotta get one a-these!

This is a Mom & Pop place that's been around for over thirty years. I talked to the Mrs. for a couple of minutes explaining that I was the new kid in town. She explained the setup where you order and they call you if it's busy but will bring your meal to the table if they're not swamped with customers.

They don't have a soda machine. They sell individual cans. I ordered the meatball sub sandwich. The bread was really soft. They cut up the meat so you don't have your meatballs falling out of the bread like most meatball sandwiches. They have a lot of marinara sauce on the sandwich and it is piping hot. The ladies out there can probably only eat half of the sandwich, that's how big it is. I would say that it had to be one of the tastiest meatball sandwiches I have ever had.

The interior is very inviting and cozy.  On my visit, there were only a few people inside, which made it nice and quiet.

I noticed a seating area for patrons who wanted to dine inside the deli.

There seemed to be some anxiety shared by the...  I assume they were the owners of the establishment - due to an employee not showing up for work.

They continued to apologize profusely for the situation.  Honestly, I was having a lovely time and felt absolutely at ease, despite their difficulties procuring help.

I finally received my meatball sub and took it back with me to the office.

I immediately noticed a difference with my sandwich and the meatball sandwiches I have become accustomed to.

Salumi's in Seattle places giant whole meatballs between two crusty pieces of Italian bread.  It is very hard to eat.

Niccoli's chops the meatballs up and combines them with their delicious sauce.  This makes it a lot easier to eat, especially since they use a softer type of bread.  However, it can get a little soggy if you allow everything to marinate too long.

My husband and I split the Italian sub and the ham/provolone sub.  The subs had no mayo or mustard but had a delightful oil and vinegar-type sauce that definitely made the subs stand out.

We shared a cannoli for dessert....holy schnikes, so fantastic!!  This is a quaint little place in a strip-mall.

I did not, so I then searched and filtered based on highest reviewed.  Niccoli's came up, and it was settled.

The parking lot, for the most part, was empty... but that didn't deter me from going in.  The smell that hit me upon entering reassured me that I had made the right choice.  Since I'm rarely in that neck of the woods, I ordered a meatball sub and an antipasto salad - knowing full well I would not be able to eat both in one sitting.  

While waiting, I struck up a conversation with the female owner, who proceeded to tell me a story about a photo on the wall I had noticed of her and her husband, over 50 years ago, on the night of their wedding night.

Just the fact that she took a few minutes to tell me about their lives that long ago while I waited for my food was worthy of at least four of these stars.  Then, as I was seated in the dining room next door, listening to Sinatra's greatest hits, the food came and it was out of this world.  Easily one of the best meatball subs I've ever consumed - the bread had the perfect chew - and wasn't soggy from the delicious fresh marinara.

The salad had banana peppers, delicious olives, provolone, three different meats (salami, mortadella and pepperoni) and quite possibly the best Italian dressing to cover it in.  There were not many others who came to eat - but plenty were in and out for various Italian needs.  Their store is small, but appeared to have anything you might need for an authentic Italian meal.  

Check this place out, whether you go for ingredients to make your own meal or want to try something they make fresh it's totally worth your time.

Like any good yelper I checked its profile out and the peoples' who's opinions and tastes I've come to trust had me sold on it. A subsequent AOL City Guide review page was less than inspiring - complaints about them closing the upstairs dining area and diners who were less-than-impressed with the menu - they (the AOLers) came off sounding like snobs in their reviews, anyway, so I didn't let it bum me out, but I wasn't sure what to expect.

Based on the price range and what I'd heard, I was prepared for a 40s-60s married couple crowd and elegant/traditional dcor that would appeal to that demographic; this assumption was further believed when we pulled up and saw those exact couples leaving the parking lot.

However, we drove up (complimentary valet is required) and went thru a wooden door into a stone stair chamber (seriously, it felt like a secret passageway in a castle) to another wooden door that opens into the bar area (I was assured on the phone when I made reservations about three days ahead of time for the Sat night that we would get a table, or you can wait for a table or belly up at the bar to eat).

Anyway, the crowd was very up-and-coming (for reals, not like Scottsdale mall Kona Grill happy hour, ""I'm in real estate"" up-and-comers) late 20s to late 30s crowd, the flat screen TV behind the bar was playing ESPN and the Cure (!) was playing...I was in love. It was still white table cloth and wood accents nice, but the subtle, muted tv and just high enough music volume were enough to make it seem more like a bar than a stuffy restaurant. 

I was told it was Dutch-inspired (so executed by the Dutch impressionist works all over the walls) but the food is basic ""new American"" grill faire. New twists on old favorites...along with favorites basic mashed potatoes (except these come out souflee style), bacon-wrapped scallops, prime rib ($32) and Chilean sea bass ($28? $34?) (all of which we ordered, and ate, and it was all excellent).

We also got a bottle of wine for $25 - not bad. That was one of the least expensive ones, it goes up to the $200s from there. Oh, we also had crme brulee (divine, freshly made with real vanilla bean and served cold, not hot) and coffee to top it all off. Whew! We were pretty drunk, very full and very, very happy with our experience. (the music selection also continued to impress, surprise me - The Killers, Morrissey

Oh! I can't forget the server...he was professional (not snobby), knowledgeable and helpful - he will give you his honest opinion on which dishes he likes and doesn't.
 
Oh! And, for a higher-dollar establishment, I was very happy to see they didn't try to charge for every little thing - for $32 I got a salt and pepper encrusted prime rib, the giant side of mashed potatoes, asparagus and a salad (you even get to choose from four specialty salads); a steal, really.

Ok, I'm done gushing. If you want a romantic dining spot, this works. If you want a nicer place to grab drinks with people who will appreciate the menu, the ambiance can't be beat.",review,6,7GC9fVWKa4a1ZmBGLH6Uww

So unique from the big flashy restaurants smattered up and down Scottsdale.  You can dine upstairs, or downstairs at the bar in a bit more casual environment.  I have to admit that I have yet to eat upstairs.  Downstairs, you can get the same menu + and easily fill up on very substantial light fare at a reasonable price.  Try the beef tenderloin toasts and you will come back again and again.  Everyone is so friendly here, from bartenders to patrons.  If only there were more places in phoenix like this!

First, the restaurant.  I give it ""four thumbs aight"".  I've had better steaks, but never in a cozier environment.  Their booths are ridiculously private and can be really romantic.  Until you stare across the way and see some baby boomers molesting each other under the table.  You can bring your own bottle here, but their corking fee was $25 or $30 which made me really kinda laugh to myself, but not out loud because i didn't want to disturb the mood of the evening or the piranhas in table 4.  

So, my $10 tip-top Malbec brought back from the actual country of Argentina via me and a large airliner (vino is amazingly good and cheap there), was now $40.  Whetever.  I just expected myself to be in LOOOVE with the food which was not the case.

However.

Their basement bar is pretty much the most unique place to drink in the Valley.  Its focused around a wood burning fire and this is precisely where you go to get a strong cocktail or a deep red wine.  If you can snag the fire-front seating you will want to park it right there all night.

Man, when they used to allow smoking down here, it was like being in the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes Lodge.  Too bad.  Another case of the gubments saving us from ourselves.",review,2,-F32Vl8Rk4dwsmk0f2wRIw

Every time we've gone, we've eaten downstairs in the bar-area.  The crowd is a little more lively.  It's also closer to the alcohol.

You can eat at the bar, tables, the couch.. the floor I suppose?  Plenty of seating (not JUST a bar)  It's a little like being in a ski lodge.  Anyway.. very cool atmosphere.

I've heard mixed reviews from friends about their entree dishes.  They're a bit expensive.  We usually order a bunch of tapas dishes and share.  The last time we went we had four or five tapas and a bottle of wine.  We spent $60 or so with tip for the three of us and all left with a full stomach and a little hammered.

The ambiance at Rokerij is such that you just want to stay and relax for the rest of the night -- (I was late to my next Friday night stop!!). The dark cavernous feel of the place lends itself well to a special night out.  Wine service was adept and the server was refilling our chardonnay very regularly.

The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.

It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  It's manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.

However, the Rokerij is number one in my book. 

I love their apps!! I love it when you can find a place and you KNOW you love their food. Some have boring, conservative menus, like....well, I shouldn't say, but there's one on the SE corner of Camelback and 32nd. 

But the Rokerij has blue crab mini tostadas that surprise your mouth with their freshness, cold lettuce (it hasn't wilted on the way downstairs to the basement from the kitchen) and it's a snack, not a meal. So, you can taste four appetizers and enjoy tasting your favorites or finding new ones and not spend lots of money just getting full on one thing.

They say the Rokerij basement is a cell-free zone. That's because as you descend each slate/rock step downwards, right off the wood front deck, the signal mostly won't go through! So, you can get in your uninterrupted girl talk or romantic moments with someone you want to be one-on-one with. I love the wood beams, the hammered copper bar, the leather furniture, the stone walls and the intimate fireplace. It's dark. And it feels good.

I usually get those blue crab tostadas, shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops and the ceviche. But then, wouldn't you know, someone told me about a new favorite, steak tacos! Huh? I don't eat beef. Sort of. Bye bye ceviche!

And the insider's secret that I will hate you for if you take my place at the bar (the offer is good at both the upstairs and downstairs bars...I just called to make sure the details were right), is that if you are sitting at the bar and order certain apps BEFORE THEIR clock strikes 6 pm, (4-5:59 pm on THEIR clock, very important), 

THEY ARE $5 EACH! 

Some don't get discounted. But my favs do! 

Tell them Roseann sent ya. They just learned I can have fun. I've been goin since they opened. I guess I just don't drink enough alcohol for them to see the fun side. Oh well. What can I say?

The food was awesome and the bartender recommended a glass of Cabernet for me, which was perfect. He didn't try to sell me on anything, he just listened to what I like and suggested I try this one. I wish I could remember what it was called, I guess I'll just have to go back. 

The ambiance is cool, the bar is downstairs, very cavern-like, I dug it. It is definitely someplace you could get cozy with your date, there is a big fireplace and lots of dark booths. The only complaint I had, which didn't even really affect me, it was so dark upstairs that I would not want to eat dinner there. It took my eyes a good two minutes just to adjust after walking in. I don't know how the staff works in that environment, but the bar was not as dark, and of course that lighting is more appropriate in an underground bar.

The grotto bar downstairs, which you access through the stone encased stairwell, is the ultimate downstairs bar in Arizona.

Rokerij is bad ass, which is why it is always wicked crowded. The ambiance is a teeny bit cowboy, some rustic Flagstaff, some Old-world European, and ALL sexy - grotto staircase leading to dim and plush with roaring fireplaces scattered about. The menu is diverse - plenty of funk and weirdness for the more adventuresome, but some more traditional favorites for your conservative friends. All I care about is that they still make me my beloved veggie quesadillas, bursting with roasted broccolini and corn and filled with just the right amount of cheese, served on a wooden cutting board with two kinds of fresh, flavorful, and just-enough-spicy salsa.

I'm not sure where all the bitching and moaning about the service come from. Our last visit here was on a packed and swinging Saturday night where we had to wait an hour for a table.

Rokerij is fast becoming a new favorite spot of mine. I went out on a limb and ordered the NY Steak, medium rare. It was fantastic. Not a huge fan of the green chilie twice baked potato thing but that's more of a personal taste issue. We all shared the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers.

One bite was enough. Heavy and rich like fudge...not my thing.

She suggested Rokerij and I wasn't sure, but we figured we'd give it a try. 

Driving along the long strip of road with little businesses surrounding the restaurant, I was a little nervous pulling into the parking lot - it looked like a stuffy log cabin, BUT there was some hope - the parking lot was pretty full. 

We walked in and the place had character! Menu items were written in chalk along the walls and it seemed like a comfy cabin-like, but kind of hip at the same time restaurant. We were told there was some seating downstairs. Downstairs? Who knew? It was great! We had a corner booth (plush, high back) facing the bar and the bar set up was great! All the liquor was neatly laid out, clean and they seemed to have everything. And they had a couple of tv screens and a fireplace (although not exactly needed in Phoenix) on this floor. 

THE FOOD WAS FAB! AND the prices, were NOT even as high as what you find in L.A. at all for what you get! 

Hubby got the PRIME RIB with broccolini and mashed potatoes. What came out was a BEAST ON A PLATE. HUGE serving of meat prepared how ordered - medium rare. Mashed potatoes in its own little crockpot - STEAMING goodness. All that for $29! That's a pretty darn good deal for the amount of meat and with sides. 

I got the Rokerij Steak which was topped with crab (THE REAL STUFF) and jalapeno hollandaise (couldn't taste the jalapeno though). I ordered the grilled beets and GCP (green chile potato) as my sides. The GCP was unique but wasn't for my tastebuds. Beets were great and again, just a hearty portion for $36 - they didn't scrimp on the crab. 

We also got appetizers - bacon wrapped scallops and a turkey chile relleno. Scallops were FAT, cooked well and flavorful (of course it helps with the bacon). Chile relleno with turkey? Um AMAZING.

We had a marketing retreat there a few years back and booked the private room (which is a great size - seats 12-15 people comfortably) and is fully equipped with a flat screen and computer for presentations and what-not. I had a friend book the room for a bachelorette party (I wouldn't necessarily have a ""party"" here... but it's certainly a great private space for small groups).

The second time I went, I sat in the main dining space, it was so-so. A little dark for my mood (it was the middle of the afternoon - I just came for lunch) and wasn't feeling the darkness dungeony vibe.

The third time I went, I found that little spot in my heart that was longing for a happy hour space such as this. The downstairs bar is by far one of my most favorite spaces. Thebar stools - large and squishy - perfect for your bum. The fireplace - awesomely lit - and oddly no warmth comes from it? There must be some crazy ventilation - I don't care how but I love it. There are a couple of large circular booths - very private - in the downstairs bar area as well - perfect size for about 4-5 adults. 

They have a superb selection of seafood - and everyone around me ordered it. From Sunday to Tues. I believe they have 1/2 priced bottles of wine, we asked the bartender for some reccomendations and he gave us a couple of samples. We ordered a very nice red from Carmel Valley - it was amazing. Coupled with the chicken tacos (quite a kick to them - disctinct horse radish nose tingle...but great spice) and onion rings (more of the gourmet variety - not too greasy at all with very unique sauces) and we had ourselves quite the happy hour.... err actually happy 4 hours... 

That's what happens when you go into a bar with no windows!!! You lose track of time...inhibitions out the window... it becomes a black hole with food and wine and friends... it just sucks you in to this vortex of happiness. Rokerij you are my new drug!",review,2,SC_bFYaDgDub7tDjKCvV_g

Not much new can be written about this amazing spot, so I will try and be brief. Went to the basement bar for Friday happy hour, and it was love at first sight. Cozy, dark, and welcoming- this is a place you can get lost in.

Grabbed a seat at the bar, and were warmly greeted. Ordered margaritas and some small plates, they were both outstanding. Tried numerous small plates, and each one was delicious and hit the spot.

If you like margaritas, you will be a happy camper. Also try the stuffed mushrooms, they are amazing.

After leaving my new favorite place, we went to the Taste of Scottsdale, and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided.

 The hole downstairs makeshifts for a great date night venue, in thanks to the lack of cellular service. You can keep your partner's attention solely on you for the duration of your meal/bottle of wine/conversation...

 I always fail to remember the after effects of said Garlic Plate. Your body will betray you, your stomach will take over and your boyfriend will be disgusted by you sleeping ever so close...

So one weekday my girl and I met up for happy hour here and we both fell in love with the ambiance as soon as we entered. We came in the wrong door downstairs, and were a little confused as to where to go lol bar in the basement was full so we were directed up the staircase. The bar there was also full but lucky for us a couple decided to head down to the basement and free'd up the seats for us :) (bet they thought we came up from down there and emptied our seats at that bar .. suckers) .

We sat down and it took a little while before we were helped, but the way we talk it didn't matter. We each ordered our drinks, prickly pear margaritas, which were absolutely delicious. Made with fresh squeezed lemon. We decided to order a few appetizers. Chile Relleno made with pork (even though I wanted duck), Ceviche and the  Beef Tenderloin toasts.  The chile relleno and toasts were to die for! The pork inside the relleno was smoky and tender and flavorful. So darn good! As were the toasts. I could have eaten two orders all by myself. The meat was so tender and tore apart with the toast without tugging. The cheese was creamy and just the right amount topping off a buttery toast. YUM!!  The ceviche was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I will for sure order the toasts again and try the garlic plate. A couple next to us ordered it and it looked delicious. 


The staff and chef there were very nice and took great care of us! I canNOT wait to go back. I have been craving it since I left.  Definitely need to make a dinner date out of it too as the eggs benedict looked so darn good! I want to try one of everything!.

Rokerij (pronounced Ro-k-ray and is the Dutch Word for Smokehouse--which raises a whole slew of questions that I won't get into) is listed as one of ""Arizona's 50 Best Restaurants"" by one of the local food bloggers (Ricky Lee Potts). It also came highly recommended by my Dad, and knowing how picky he is, I knew I had to check this place out. 

Appetizers/Small Plates:

Bacon-Wrapped Scallops- I saw this as one of the review highlights and knew I had to have it. The BWS were huge, cooked perfectly and they are served with four amazing sauces that are the Chef's choice for the night. On this night they were 2 kinds of Green Salsa, Red Salsa and a Hollandaise sauce. My clear favorites were the Hollandaise and the Red Salsa but they were all good. 5*

Pan-Seared Salmon- Small bite-sized pieces of Salmon with a Chipotle-Mayo. The Salmon itself could've used some seasoning but the Chipotle-Mayo was excellent. 4*

Santa Fe Trail:

Carne Adovada- Smoked Pork shoulder that's simmered in a Red Chile sauce and served with Rice and Beans. The Rice and Beans were pretty standard, but the Pork itself was excellent. It literally seemed to get better and better as the meal went on but it also got progressively hotter and hotter as the meal went on; I was sweating like Britney Spears on Jeopardy by the time I was done eating. 4.5*

Chile Potato- Apparently this is one of the dishes that Rokerij is famous for. It's a fire-roasted green Hatch Chile that's stuffed with a mashed potato mixture. I'm not sure if I had it on an off-night, or what, but it just didn't do it for me. I mean everything was there for a stupendous dish but there just wasn't any flavor. I had my sis and Bro-in-law try some just to verify it wasn't me and they agreed it was a fail. 2*

Beverages- Rokerij has a really impressive wine selection -which I'm not really into- and a mediocre beer selection; I was not impressed with their draft selection. They also have an über-cool underground (literally and figuratively!) bar that is separate from the restaurant itself; I can imagine the shenanigans that ensue there! 4*

Service & Ambiance- Our waitress was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu because my sister always has questions (Oy gevalt...) and she answered them all quickly and to her satisfaction. Rokerij is very dark; has a nice wood and brick interior; and even has a fireplace going at all times--which is kinda odd seeing that it's in Arizona. The ambiance is definitely set for a date night kinda mood: very romantic and sexy--not the place you wanna bring a precocious 3-year-old (Whoops!). 4.75*

Value- Pretty good value for a really nice place like this. I'd say the avg entrée runs anywhere from $15-30; which is pretty good for high quality food. 4*

If you're looking for a great restaurant to impress a special someone; a place to celebrate a special event; or even something as casual as a date night then this is the place for you. I wouldn't recommend bringing kids with you as it's just not a kid friendly place and that's ok, too. You don't have to take the little monsters everywhere.",review,11,iChZhRINmSKYoHhesh7grA

Located in the same parking lot right next to the new Richardson's. There is a really cool patio that connects the two restaurants with an outdoor Bar. Instantly puts you in the party zone and makes you feel right at home.

This is the first time my wife and I have been to the Rokerij and it was truly a fun and happy experience. Been to Dick's Hideaway and the older Richardsons many times in the past. The selection on the menu here has several of the same tasty good SW options with some really nice EuroAmerican surprises.

Love the way you can instantly smell the aroma of the Pecan wood coming from the sizzling grill. Pecan gives the food some very nice flavor and that extra kick. Everything here and his other restaurants always taste great and leave you satisfied.

Upstairs and downstairs are both the Rokerij now. Upstairs is quite a bit larger with a nice bar and a larger seating area. Downstairs has a top secret elevator or you can take the stairs. It is smaller and offers food and drinks as well. Could even be a nifty bomb shelter in a parallel universe.

We started off with some Prime Rib Sliders and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. My boss and his lovely wife ordered the New Mexican Platter and the Salt and Pepper Encrusted Prime Rib. My wife order the awesome Chimayo Chicken and yours truly went with the tasty Grilled Swordfish Special. Chocolate Flan with a 1/2 shot of Grand Marnier completed the trifecta.

Really love the way they layer the flavors. The atmosphere of this place and friendly servers are also a delight. We arrived early and were able to get a large table by their cozy rustic fireplace.

Now, let me make it clear, I was an idiot, and I didn't print the coupon, because it clearly stated you could merely show it to your server from your phone.

So I did that. And because I did, I didn't read ""the fine print"", which clearly stated what exactly you were entitled to.
The coupon: http://goo.gl/tuIS

So after we had placed our order, I looked at the coupon again, and noticed the listing of what was included in the entree selection. Feeling a case of caveat emptor, I searched out our server, and informed her of my mistake.

Her response was fantastic; she said what we had ordered already (shells florentine) would be probably be ok, but she would verify.
She did indeed check, and they claimed that since neither I nor they caught until well after the order was placed (it was only about 5 or 10 mins...) they would go ahead and make the adjustment on my check.

That's customer service, beyond and above. I fully expected to have to change my order, or pay full price for the shells, and would not have felt that it were anyone's fault but my own.

The food was pretty tasty. Along with the shells, we ordered the Brooklyn Family Style pizza, which had pepperoni, sausage, and fresh basil.

The shells were pretty good, but nothing phenomenal.

The basil aroma that accompanied the arrival of the pie was wonderful! The sausage volume was a bit sparse, but the pizza was delicious, and I would recommend it.

It was a beautiful night, so we sat on the patio. The table that we were at had a slight ant problem, but once I cleared them, they didn't return.

You can walk into almost any pizza joint, ask for a slice and be happy with your two buck piece of cheesy gooey heaven on (slightly) crunchy dough. No need for production value to enjoy good pizza. Moving to the west side of the U.S. I don't miss the cold weather, but I do miss pizza.

We had/shared between us Spinach salad (sans the bacon), Caprese, Spinach/Artichoke dip, & Zucchini sticks were all Absolutely AHHhmazing as usual but our main reason 4 coming: Veganizza & Pizza Bianca we had r PERFECTION 2 die 4... seriously Exceptional in flavors & texture!!!

   On previous visits we've had the Soho salad pizza, greek salads, Eggplant & the Chelsea chopped salad (minus the bacon)... all So Delicious & especially luv the salad pizza concept, pls keep this 2!! 

   We usually like 2 sit in the outside section because my guilty pleasure is watching any of the birds flitting around the bushes & scavenging 4 crumbs which I someXs 'accidentally' drop in my occasional clumsiness. Also the service has always been impeccable whenever we've gone which is truly appreci8ed & a very integral part of the dining experience!

   We luv the cannolis/kisses & we've had the tiramisu in the past which was AWESOME 2 (but not offered on menu anymore)? We have yet 2 try the limoncello cake but will save that in anticip8ion 4 our next visit. NYPD ROCKS & really hope they keep these Veg~head/Gluten~Free faves of ours so we can continue our business w/ this establishment!!!",review,1,PZHWkUsosYYeZJiCLX-Bdg

My last carrier was Alltel, and Verizon gobbled them up this year.  Being a cell phone owner since the days when they came in a bag like a heavy small carry-on bag, I have to say I HAVE NEVER HAD A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE IN A CELL PHONE STORE BEFORE.   EVAH. 

I've had a Treo for many years.  Last year, I dropped the phone and broke the screen.   Went into the Alltel store and they literally said to me, ""sorry you're screwed; we don't replace screens; you have no insurance; you're still under contract"" - so my only solution was to buy a new one for $600 according to the very harried and unpleasant rotund pimply fellow at the Alltel store.   Methinks there must be another way!

So I got on line and found this PDAparts.com for replacement screens.   They warn you: this voids any warranty!!!   But it was ""only"" $70 so I went for it.  They actually have a step-by-step video posted on YouTube on how to replace the screen.  Scary, but my trusty friend/co-worker Chris is an engineer so he did the dirty work for me in about 5 minutes flat.  YAY.    Phone worked perfectly until.... one day... the screen just went blank.

So I'm hosed now right?  And it's December.   The phone technically still WORKED, as in: it rings, and I can fumble to answer it... but I can't see who's calling or who is texting me or make calls... or read my emails... so it was kinda limiting.

So with much trepidation I wandered myself over to the Verizon store on Camelback, figuring I was now only 1 month away from the end of my contract and maybe I just had to bite the bullet and switch to a new phone.    They don't make the Treo 755p anymore, and I really didn't want to learn how to use a whole new phone... too busy.  But I guess I gotta. 

So you walk in and they ask you:  do you need service or sales, and what's your name?    Service... Jane.     They put you on a list which is on a big monitor, and tell you: you are 4th in line for service.   Sigh... look around... and not 5 minutes later, I'm called up. 

The very friendly and CUTE guy who helped me took a look and agreed, the screen is fried.    Do you want to pick out a new phone today, or can you wait a few days to get a refurbished 755p?    Huh?  I could get another 755p?    Yes we will replace your phone but we don't have them HERE so you'd have to wait a few days.   Um... okay... I guess I can wait, but, how much will that cost?   ""Oh, it'll be free.""    FREE?    Sold! 

The people working there were joking around with each other, easy going and super helpful.  There were other people in the store who were clearly stressed and in a bad mood, and from what I observed these folks were super-great at defusing them. 

Something good is going on at that shop and based on my experience (a) I highly recommend them; and (b) I'm sticking with Verizon!",review,2,pk4y8PJdccJysYBpBA-gcg

But, Giuseppe's is quite deserving of the highest rating because it really is a gem of a place. 

Voted New Times Best of Phoenix Neighborhood Italian (2003), veal (2004) and BYOB (2005), Giuseppe's certainly has earned such accolades. However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I'll most definitely be trying the veal. And since I went with Robert M, you should know that BYOB is a given. Well, honestly, since I showed up it's almost certain that I'm carrying some form of alcohol on my person. 

After watching a decidedly emotionally-charged movie at Camelview (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, an amazing must-see even though a key element in the film is grossly misleading--PM me if you've seen it and I'll share) Robert M and I needed to do something to appreciate the goodness in life so we decided to devirginize ourselves of the Giuseppe's experience. It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth. We also split the lasagna which was made with fresh pasta and plated with the most divine ""gravy"" [for all the Italians, although I'm Irish] that we've ever tasted. So *smooth* and not bitter or acidic or sweet or anything less than heavenly. If I could bathe in this, I would. But, since I'm not a splosher... :blush: 

If only I wouldn't have eaten so much popcorn in the hour before going to Giuseppe's, I would have indulged in so much more. But, alas, I have found a reason to take this Avenue kid back to the Streets: Giuseppe's.",review,10,nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw

I am glad I am an avid viewer of this channel. My father, being the martyr that he is, decided he didn't want to go to dinner for his 55th birthday. So after some hemming and hawing, I bullied him into it. The next question, Where do we go? I told him about this recent episode of Triple D and to my amazement he had seen it to and suddenly he was all happy about a birthday dinner. 

Like most places nowadays, they don't take reservations. My brother called ahead and was told it should be fine for our time for a table of 8, a Wednesday night mind you. We were seated and take everyone else's word if not mine, the restaurant is small(read:TINY). There are probably 12 tables, max. We were given menus quickly and had our drink orders taken and brought out promptly. The table started with a mixed bruschetta of a traditional tomato and basil and a pesto with tomato. Both were excellent. They have a bunch of other choices as well. We also had the caprese salad, fresh balls of mozzarella, tomatoes, and romaine covered in balsamic vinegar. This too was great. 

Dinner choices were varied. I had a fettuccine with chicken, green chilies, and sun dried tomato. It had a garlic-wine sauce. Sprinkle on a little red pepper flakes for a little extra heat and you'll be happy. Get the fresh pasta, pay the extra buck, and you'll be one smiling mother#$*&er! Fresh pasta makes a world of difference. I sampled everything at the table. The macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, the ravioli, and the penne with sausage. The regular plain old red pasta sauce they use is great! It had such a nice sweetness to it I could have had a bowl of it.  Get the mac & cheese.  It is baked to perfection!  We aren't talking Kraft mac and cheese here either people.  This has real cheese, not some powder cheese.

We also indulged in dessert and coffee. The flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato was delicious. The cappuccino was great too. I was told the key lime cheesecake was good as well. 

The dining experience was nice. I thought the prices were reasonable and the serving size ample. We spoke with the owner, Richard, for long stretches throughout the meal and he was very personable and answered any questions or gave suggestions on meals. He saw me taking a picture of my food and asked if this was going to be on Yelp! I assured him it would be. He told me I wasn't getting anything free because of it, with a smile and a laugh. Love the NY attitude. 

For those that gave a bad review, I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. NO other Italian restaurants in the valley use fresh pasta, maybe Pasta Brioni. So, if you thought Buca, Olive Garden(barf), or Macaroni Grill used it, you are sadly mistaken.",review,5,1ylYrKcGNA8MDkhNBTjHMA

Was on a business trip, had one night in Phoenix, one meal, wanted it to be memorable. Researched heavily on Yelp and Triple D and came down to this one little Italian restaurant.

Work friend and I agreed we had to try the two dishes highlighted on DDD; 5 meat bolognese with homemade pasta and Osso Bucco. First started with a salad with fresh mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes, basil. Wow it was so fresh, so amazing. The waiter suggested we get the bolognese sauce with a special homeade pasta that was filled with ricotta but yet light and airy and smaller than a penne but not hollow. Very unique softness to it and it was just incredible with this meat sauce. 

Second I have to say I would not typically order osso bucco but since it was highlighted on the show as a melt in your mouth good, I couldn't resist. This night it was made with veal shank. This was three huge veal shanks that filled the entire plate with a homeade lingini pasta with ruffled edges like lasagna noodles and this wonderful dark rich tomato/wine flavor sauce that was just amazing by itself. Wow you literally did not have to chew this meat and I am not exaggerating! 

We were just awestruck over the flavors of these dishes, the cozy environment and the amazing friendliness of the restaurant. The owner came over several times to ask us how we liked it and we both were so impressed with the customer service overall.

To top it off, our amazing waiter was nice enough to save us the last caramel gelato with praline pecans crunched up small, OMG so smooth, sweet and perfect! I cannot wait to bring my other work associates here when I come back to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!",review,2,eA0q87OWyV_PvkuhW2IuvQ

If like me, you grew up thinking that your friend Vinnie's mothers daily offering of Italian Food, with aromas wafting all through the apartment building, was something very special and real Italian Food - THIS IS IT! You will have found Nirvana, as have I!

Until now, I had almost given up hope for what I call ""Old World Italian Food"" prepared with love and the most incredible ingredients available. It is here and being served in a friendly small environment by a knowledgeable and wonderful wait staff.  Not to mention that  the Owner is usually present and generally talks to everyone, making certain that all are satisfied. Now I ask you, is that PRIDE or what?

Based on talking with adjacent Diners, everything on the Menu;  both the ""Today's Menu"" (Changes sometimes daily) and the ""Full Menu,"" seems to be pretty fabulous and receiving ""Rave Reviews"" from my fellow Diners!

Looking at previous Reviews, as well as Guy Fieri's recommendation, I had to have the Bolognese Ragu on my first visit. I have yet to have everything on the menu, but here are the choices I have made on my visits to date and each is NOT to be missed:

        Bolognese Ragu - Don't ask! Just order it. Seven meats and homemade  
        Pasta that lives up to all of the previous fabulous Reviews! Like so many 
        before me, I am not certain I can eat here ever without having this incredible 
        dish, which leaves little room for anything else. Share with a friend so you can 
        have more of their remarkable dishes.

        Burrata (Appetizer) - Mozzarella like you have never had. Do NOT overlook it 
        if  it is available. The description doesn't do it justice, but it is described as 
        a ""ball of mozzarella filled with shredded mozzarella and cream."" If you love 
        Mozzarella -this is ""MOZZARELLA MECCA!"" 

        Antipasto (Appetizer) - An absolute work of art! Do NOT be fooled by the 
        Menu designation of Small (they also have Large), it is NOT small, but can be 
        shared by two (I refuse to share!)  Incredible morsels of meat, cheese and 
        vegetables, with the proper amount of dressing.

        Pasta e Fagioli (Appetizer) - I have a friend who says you can judge ALL 
        Italian Restaurant by their Pasta e Fagioli. This is a light (meant to be, it's an 
        Appetizer!) flavorful mixture of beans and pasta that is oh so satisfying, with 
        just a hint of spice.

        Spaghetti and our Famous Meatballs - Not to be confused with your Mothers, 
        as she probably could not make this rendition. The meatballs in my sampling 
        were made from Veal with Ricotta and other special ingredients. If spaghetti 
        and meatballs were like this everywhere, we would all be Italian! Hint - you 
        can have the meatballs alone as an appetizer or a side dish.

        Bread and Olive Oil - Nothing remarkable about the bread here, which is a 
        surprise, but it is the Olive Oil (with Giuseppe's label on it) that is the star. No 
        Balsamic needed, just pure goodness with salt and pepper to your own taste. 
        Take a bottle home (I have!) and pair it with your favorite bread.

Giuseppe's has definitely replaced The Restaurant (Now Pizzeria Bianco) as my favorite Phoenix Italian Restaurant. The love, pride and caring that has gone into each and every dish is more than apparent. There is no need to go elsewhere, unless for a diversion you wish to go to Andreoli Italian Grocer for their bread!

I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!",review,1,kpo20fBM7l-C5yX5gcAd5w

The lobby is beautiful and not a reflection of the outside.  Ritz Carlton takes their tea very seriously.  They have their own personal tea sommelier.  A perfectly groomed man named Jeffrey.  Perfect hair, perfect tan, perfect teeth, perfect suit.  Jeffrey is passionate about tea and about the tea experience, he even has his own tea line.  We are immediately greeted and seated by him.  He explains the daily offerings and provides insight on how the teas are brewed.   He has a way of making you feel welcome.  Unfortunately Grandma is with us so I did not choose the ""mar-tea-ni"".  A waiter brings our tea over and all kinds of yummy treats.  They are not the traditional sandwiches but modern takes on afternoon tea type food.  Music starts playing, I look over and there is Jeffrey singing with the band.  The band is on an intermission and Jeffrey makes the rounds to see that everyone is comfortable.  Damn he is good!

Got our keys at the front desk, and were ushered up to our luxurious room.  It was quite spacious, and very well furnished.  The bed was huge and soft, and extremely comfortable.  All in all, the room was great.  The only downfall was the fact that the room was dark, and there was not adequate lighting.

The wedding was great.  All the food was kick-ass and the banquet room was well-decorated.  Definitely a great place for such an event.  It was an overall wonderful experience.

I spent three nights here and from the moment of arrival I was astounded at the high level of customer service. Everything from the little things to the big ones are taken care of and they go above and beyond.

I pulled up in my rental car, handed it over to the valet, and he asked my name. I gave it along with the keys and walked inside to check in. Before I even reached the check-in counter I was greeted by name and welcomed (way to go, Mr Valet, radioing ahead like that. Pretty slick. I didn't even see your radio.). Free lemon water and snacks await in the very nicely-apportioned lobby. I didn't try any but they looked nice sitting there like an oasis in the middle of the desert. 

Rooms were also well furnished and roomy with great views of the surrounding areas. There is also an in-room safe which I always need for my valuables. Not. I don't even have any valuables that aren't actual living creatures. Like a few humans and a dog...but I digress...

About the service...okay so keep in mind I'm basically a blue collar guy living a white collar life. It can be pretty confusing for me at times. And I suffer an identity crisis in places like this. Like, for example, when I see staff running for the front door to open it for me each and every time, I want to beat them to it. I want to say ""Chill out, young man. I open my own doors."" 

But they are quite determined and it became a bit of a competition between me and the doormen to see who could get there first. By about the middle of my stay, I learned how to time it right so that when they were distracted I'd sneak up and open it myself. I often managed to beat them to the outer door, but then they'd slip inside and open the inner door for me. 

Rats. Foiled again.

Every time I walked out of the hotel they asked what they could do for me. Need a ride? Directions? Coming out for a smoke? We'd be happy to light it for you. Interested in a cigar? Can I have a drink brought out for you? 

No. I just want to experience the dry heat. Leave me be! 

But it's all good. If you want, you could just act like you're accustomed to such royal treatment and say something like ""Very well done, Andrew. A little faster with that door next time would be simply fabulous.""

But I couldn't do that with a straight face. 

Let's see...local area is very nice. The Biltmore Shopping Center is right across the street. You're there in about five minutes (walking). It contains a high end outdoor shopping center with many restaurant choices, including some chains you'll recognize and a few local options. 

An earlier reviewer mentioned the desk chair in the room looks like a fugitive from a dining room, not really an office chair. I thought this was funny when I saw the chair in my room because he was right. I've included a photo of the ""fugitive chair"" just for laughs. But for a fugitive, it is a comfortable chair. It's okay, Ritz. We'll let this one slide.

At the end of your stay, they call you in the room to ask how your visit was and if they could improve anything. At first I thought it was a recording but then the person said my name and waited for my response. So I'm really glad I didn't make a sarcastic comment while she was talking at first (like I usually do). But wow...how much time must that take to call each room? 

Pretty impressive.",review,4,xR7T-HpPJRFBh-wO0c3XMQ

I recently visited the Ritz Carlton for a high tea lunch. When my Mom and I arrived, we realized that we were the only two guests who had made a reservation for high tea and we started to think twice about having high tea. While we were in the midst of contemplating our decision, Jeffrey walked up to us with a smile on his face. He was so friendly and welcoming and encouraged us to do high tea. He was so welcoming that we immediately made up our mind and started our very own private high tea experience! Although we were the only two guests doing high tea, they still ""put on the Ritz"" for us by bringing in Jeffrey to serve us and a pianist to play the baby grand piano during our tea. We felt like royalty! 

Jeffrey isn't a server. He is in charge of the high tea and incredibly experienced. He is a tea sommelier and in fact, makes the teas they serve himself! After seating us, Jeffrey went over the tea menu with us. Knowing that we were in the presence of an expert, we asked Jeffrey to take the lead and pick the three teas for our adventure. Our first course included a variety of tea sandwiches along with our first tea which was a peach tea. We leisurely enjoyed our tea and sandwiches and enjoyed the beautiful piano music. Because we were the only high tea guests, we had the undivided attention of Jeffrey which was a treat in itself. The second course consisted of delicious scones and three different jams presented in chocolate contains that we could eat! It was truly delectable. The tea to accompany that course was an herbal raspberry tea. Our final course was a three tier tray of small deserts, some of which were infused with the house-made teas! We enjoyed chocolate chai tea with this course. Every bite was delicious and the entire experience was girly, classy and royal. 

There's a reason the Ritz Carlton coined the phrase ""putting on the Ritz."" Even though we were the only two guests who reserved high tea, they still pulled out all the stops and treated us like royalty. Jeffrey knows the secret to customer service and because he walked over and made us feel welcome, we stayed and ultimately had an experience that I will always remember. 

**** Note: they do several events throughout the year to go with high tea, including ladies social events, hat events, etc. Keep an eye on their calendar so you too can ""put on the Ritz!""",review,11,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

High tea was completely booked that day and for several days after, but after learning it was our anniversary, Jeffrey agreed to squeeze us in that afternoon!  And the tea, and the service, was warm, inviting, and in a word, delectable.

Hot sourdough rolls were a good start. Moved onto the flashed fried calamari with a trio of sauces. It was light and perfectly done. I had side spinach salad, my husband the house salad. Both were fresh, a good size and not overdressed. 
My main was the Lobster and Seafood Steamer. It was larger than I expected for the price. The seafood steamed in white wine were were perfectly done. Came with garlic bread and I just sopped up the sauce. Mmmm.

I was here not too long ago and got the Italian Beef.  Good.  I told the cook to make it sloppy.  He did so and made it juicy and drippy and soggy...the way I like it.

Alas, this sandwich failed to take me back to Chicago.  BUT...it is still an awesome sandwich.  It just doesn't have the taste I remember from my childhood, which was from a long forgotten hole in the wall that probably isn't there anymore.  Whenever I hear of Italian Beef, I can almost taste that place from back in Chicago's offering.  I was little when I had it, and my uncle's girlfriend gave it to me.  To a little kid, getting something so tasty from such a pretty lady...that sticks in your memory banks.  

I have only had one sandwich take me back there.  Olympic Gyros' is still great, though.  I'm just over nostalgic.  

I see a review that states this isn't Greek food done well.  I cannot say, because I am ignorant to true Greek cuisine... something I hope to remedy before my days are over.  But this IS Chicago food done well.  This IS greasy spoon done well.  I believe that is what the owner is shooting for.

Yes, they have wings now.  I love that they promoted this event.  Awesome specials on the wings going on now.  I think they even gave some away at the very beginning.  
Anyway, I got a dozen and a half for under $6.  Yes that's right.  I got naked wings and then a dozen hot.  The hot wings are what you want when you go to get wings.  Not gourmet.  Not high class.  But friggin' good and cheap.  These are the kind of wings that you run and get at like 11 at night when you're playing Spades and need something GOOD.  These are not frilly, froo froo wings.

The Merc represents a different time and generation when people had jobs, money and class.  Think 10 years ago when people who were 25 were working for companies instead waiting tables, There are no meatheads here. It's not a sausage fest in which 80% of the place is full of guys in groups of 5 who are all staring down the few attractive women in the place. There are no thug or redneck bouncers at the door trying to intimidate you or make you feel small. In short this is a place with class and substance.

It makes me laugh when people say it's nice and dark because that used to be the norm before Scottsdale decided to turn Porn-star. Thankfully, the Merc still has that vibe in which you can actually talk to people. I also laugh at the concept of ""metrosexual dress"" which for all intents and purposes means the people here dress sexy but not slutty. Is there cocaine here...it wouldn't suprise me because the people here can afford it unlike the 30K millionaire waiters who need to make their 8 am classes on Monday morning in Tempe",review,1,jQxxHLXLbFsNYNWNdSjRKQ

There are scenes from both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged that remind me of the atmosphere at MercBar, and I really love pretending like I am a character in the books. I take nerd to the next level, obviously. 

The ambiance is timeless with the low couches, leather chairs, dark wood paneling, and super dim lighting. There are candles everywhere, and most of the customers come dressed very nicely. 

The drinks are fantastic! The bartender, Brent, makes the best drinks: take advantage of it if you are able to snag a drink from him. The waitresses are all very nice and will walk you through their signature cocktails if you so desire. 

I just tried the cheese and fruit plate, and I think it is the perfect pairing for any of the drinks on the menu. It provides a little something for your stomach while you throw all those drinks back.

From my first time going all the way to my most recent time, I've always experienced the best service.  They're very knowledgeable and always willing to teach their customers more about their business or share their own opinions.  They are very patient and very friendly as well.    
Now their selection is very big compared to many of the other gold bullion and stamp places around phoenix or probably in all of AZ.  I recently moved here from CA, and have went to many gold bullion and stamp stores, and this is by far the one with the biggest selection.    They won't have EVERY single size and country that makes gold coins, but they do have their share of interesting things.   They don' jUST have gold, they have a LOT of silver as well, a big selection of notes, old US coins, and coin supplies.  

Negative things others may say that shouldn't be a factor into a low rating.  

People who come here often are impatient and get mad that they don't get helped right away.  Note that they are very attentive to Every single customer they come across and that some customers may have a lot of questions.  Blame the  customer who came before you, not the people who work there.    Come on a day when you aren't in some rush.  I come on days that I want to just relax and have nothing planned, that way I'm never in a rush when i come and heck, I may see things I haven't seen before in the store, or you may actually see something you like that others bring in.  

Another thing people may get mad about is getting turned down for having fakes.   For example.  If I was a gentleman who came in with 20 silver dollars and was told they are fake, I'd be pretty mad.  But I would not express my anger towards the person who told me they are fake.  It is NOT their fault, nor did they sell you those fake silver dollars.  DO your own research people.  It ISN'T that hard to get into this stuff.    

I'll be honest.  I'm guilty of being someone who used to think coin collecting or gold and silver was for weird and nerdy people because I used to think this stuff was complicated.  But in the end I became one of them.  This is probably the easiest thing to understand and learn about, and of the smartest things you can do for security and insurance reasons(unless ur a numismatist)

I went on a Sunday night around 7pm - granted, not the busiest time for a hotel restaurant, but we ended up being the ONLY party the entire night.  That's 2 cooks, 1 server, 1 busser and 1 bartender (and probably 1 manager somewhere) on the clock for me and my partner.  Yeah, not gonna work unless the hotel heavily subsidizes their operation.  I asked our waitress if it's always like this and she sort of said yes, but with occasional exceptions like when Willie Nelson came in and tipped her $500, which almost paid her entire rent that month.

The food is outstanding - I have not a single complaint on anything.  We ordered salads, soup, burgers and dessert and everything is SO good.  The price was decent with my restaurant.com coupon, but even without, I would have just skipped the dessert and still come in around $50 for two with tip.  It's well worth it.

Ambiance is nice at night - all tables candle lit and a nice view of the hotel's pool if you sit in one of the booths.  I'd go back in a heartbeat if I lived in Phoenix.  I sincerely hope they beef up the advertising and get people IN here, because it's worth it.  I suspect in a more visible location there'd be a line out the door, but hotel full service restaurants are always tricky.

If you have a rest.com coupon, use it NOW because they stop accepting them as of 1/1/13.  Oh and by the way, the other pictures users have posted don't do the place justice.  It's much nicer than those look.  Bon appetit!",review,1,e3LzMIrC6FtN9QeTvWiGag

I will say I had a great time, because some how the next day I ended up with a cheesecake factory pint glass in my freezer...and I know I didn't get this at the novelty station. :) In any event I am giving this place 5 stars! I would suggest going there if you can for good spirits good times and good food.",review,2,Ofxlhi_HKp7myFDpwg9aIA

Dear Cheesecake Factory, 
Say hello to your newest fan! I always imagined The Cheesecake Factory to be one of those places you go to for a boring corporate meeting or on a date with one of those cheesy guys who believes that this fancy Biltmore location will woo you off your feet (replacement for charm). 

After trying this place out, I have completely changed my mind! The menu was extensive with an impressive variety of plates! I ordered these Vietnamese rice paper rolls that were just as delicious as the ones from the Vietnamese deli down the street. My friends ordered plates that were huge and mouth watering! To top it all off, the prices were extremely low and an exceptional value! I'll be stopping by whenever I'm in a mood to eat beyond my means :) 

The staff was nice, nothing over the top, but with great locations and great values, the service is over shadowed by the food!",review,2,Mmew2rqnwj8FW3qD9wsaQQ

It used to be that I would typically get the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which by the way, is sinful. Well, I guess they all are. It has an Oreo crust, chocolate chips throughout and on the top, and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. Then they introduced the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I'm like, seriously, Cheesecake Factory? It has a moist, red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake. It also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting. I came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token (as my husband puts it, yeah right!). I got the Cookie Dough slice and then I noticed the Red Velvet which I thought was just a limited time. So what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices. $16 later (yikes!) but I am the happiest girl in the world.",review,4,RxfFQxUtSIGYwTKU_rvAeg

I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time.

Their menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.  

Today I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me!

I will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.  

I will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of ""15 minute to go"" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's ""free"" parking but they shove you way in the back on the ""north"" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall.

My advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts...

If it is in good shape and  came from Needless Markdown, or Bags Fourth Street,  and not from Tarjet or Wally world, then consign it at Well Suited.  While you are there, it is natural to want to look around and usually you can find something that is easy to take home.  One word of warning.  This is not a thrift shop so don't expect prices like you find a Saver's or Goodwill.  I sent a friend there who was expecting just that and he was sorely disappointed. 

A man should be able to go in to Well Suited, and if he wanted, walk out with a really nice wardrobe, both dress and casual,  from head to toe including acessories such as watches, shoes, belts ties and sunglasses all at reasonable prices.  There are some really good buys to be had here.  Most of the merchandise is designer with labels you will know.  If you don't,  ask Jenny or her staff.  If they don't know, they will look it up on the internet.  The other day I saw a t shirt from Barcelona by  a Spanish designer who is at the top of his game.  i know what this man's clothes run, and at $37, it really was a steal.

I do think what this store has over other men's reale stores is a staff that makes you feel welcome and helps you as you want help.  They are as friendly to someone in their 70's as they are to men in their 20's and you see as many of one as the other.  A good example of this is what I saw on the fourth of July., A young man from Lithuania, obviously a regular customer, came in with his mother and sister.  Neither of them spoke English, or knew American sizes.  He was certain, that,  Jenny, the men's manager, who ""is one of my best friends in America"" will know what to do!  I asked her after she got the ladies set up next door how she knew him, maye she had been dating him.   She said no, he was just a customer who drove in from Glendale to shop with them. It didn't surprise me in the least. I felt comfortable asking Jenny that as I have know her since she graduated from high school.  I know the work she puts into making it a great place for a man to shop at.   Excellent merchandise is not enough if men don't feel at ease shopping at a men's store.  When it comes to shopping, a man always needs a place like this!  I'm just afraid one of these days someone is going to steal her away to Sedona one of her favorite places!

Just so you know, when they sell your things, you have the choice of getting cash or taking it in trade.  Wise individuals, they want you to keep you money on account and spend it there, so they give you more when you take it in trade.  Don't be surprised though if your Raybans that you have never worn don't bring as much as you think.  Jenny will probably gets you as much as your going to get unlike another store at 32nd Street and Shea.  I about threw up when I saw what they got two pairs of unworn Merrill boots  I took there just to try some place different for a change  I'm not going to say I'd never consider going to another place and see what they have to offer.  I just know Well Suited is a consistently comfortable place for a man to enjoy going in and doing some shopping and that isn't all that bad!

Just thought to say something about two different things.  Ever gotten a gift card to someplace that is going to take you forever to find something you need to use it? The money you take in trade can be used at any of the stores of this group which includes women's and furniture and accessory stores.    Even better, I think is what happens if something  you consign doesn't sell.  You can take it back or they will donate it to a group that supports no kill animal shelters.   I appreciate the owners of the company for supporting this very worthy cause.",review,4,4sIK_74UwkKU9YQXIfgCdg

I had the Parisian (Paree-zee-ahn) baguette and it DEFINITELY did not disappoint. EPIC PASS.  I was very impressed on the tastiness and freshness of the ingredients.  The bread itself had the desirable softness and texture that I would expect from a genuine baguette (as I had in France).  The saltiness of the ham, the balance of the mayo, the eggs and lettuce was just superb! I truly enjoyed every bite!

I had a side of pasta which tasted kind of fresh and dressed with I thought was bleu cheese (I didn't clarify with them).  For beverage, I had a very good tropical tasting, iced tea.

I thought the decor was friendly, warm and inviting with French artwork while music played in the background.  The owner and his wife basically run the show.  They were very friendly and attentive.

There are so many reviews about Trader Joe's in other locations, so by now you most likely know all about their amazing selection of ""Joe's"" brand merchandise - ranging from pasta sauce to liquid soap.  If there is a Joe's brand for something - get it.  It will always be good.  And while their produce section is smaller than some of the other stores, it's not my main reason for going there so I can pick something up if it looks good and it's a fun extra.  They used to have almost no meat selection, but it's gotten better after their recent expansion.  It's no AJ's, but they have some nice basic and pre-prepared options.

20637,Sy-hmzSH1OmWpHmAfZtxRA,3,2009-05-03,2,McsuEk127LjDECbWwtnO6A,5,"As a bachelor, I have to agree with Abu: TJ's is paradise.  It's seriously the reason I picked the Biltmore neighborhood two years ago when I moved from LA.  It made my move seamless.  I can honestly say that for the last 8 years I have been going to TJ's weekly (first in LA, and now in PHX), and perhaps a little sadly, I tend to buy the same things each and every week.  If TJ's closed, I would die. 

Food:
-- TJ's hummus: all of them are awesome, even the white bean hummus
-- TJ's whole wheat pita bread, and the mini pitas.  Just dip these guys in the hummus (see above)
-- TJ's dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).  Don't buy the more expensive canned dolmas they have from Greece.  Trust me.  TJ's is in a jar, you get a few more dolmas in there and they are firmer and don't have that old canned taste.  I think the Greek ones have been sitting on a shelf somewhere for years.
-- TJ's nuts, all of them.
-- TJ's frozen fish and shrimp.  They have excellent sea food and it's all been extremely good in my experience.  Their raw peeled shrimp makes for an easy meal of your choice.  I like to saute with garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice.  
-- TJ's Greek yogurt.  They have a ""brand"" name, but stick with TJ's.  I have tried them both and still think that the house brand rules

Household Items:
-- Dr. Bronner's magic soap!  This stuff is great and will make you smell good (if you don't already smell good)
-- STAY AWAY FROM THEIR PAPER TOWELS.  In the last few years they seem to be carrying more household stuff, but their paper towels are worthless and actually smell kind of strange.  If you spill something and reach for a TJ's towel, the spill will get worse.  These towels repel all moisture.  Go to Target and get the real thing or use a washable dish rag.
-- Desert Essence face wash.  For a bachelor, this stuff is great.  It's a simple face wash that does what it says and doesn't leave you smelling like an orchard

Drinks:
-- Their juices are all amazing, especially their unpasteurized orange juice, but it's not cheap.
-- Water is essential but I am a filterer at home so just buy their sparkling mineral water.  It's the best deal in town.
-- Beer: They have the large bottles of Chimay, Arrogant Bastard Ale, and the usual suspects of trendy breweries such as Stone, Stella, Guinness, and some of the Japanese brands.  These are great, but my recommendation is for the Simpler Times lager.  It's only $2.99 for a 6-pack!  That's 50 cents a beer.  At first I was afraid, I was petrified...but seriously, I even served this beer to a female guest the other night and she was totally impressed.  Pour it in a pint glass and Simpler Times will stack up to the best brews.
-- Wine: You have to be careful with TJ's wine.  Yes, they have some cheap wines, but you will have a serious time trying to swallow some of them.  Stick to the above $6 bottles at a minimum, and if you want to be safe, aim for the $11 plus bottles.  Also remember that southern hemisphere wines can be a bit younger because of the grow season.  For Chilean wines and Argentinian wines my price rubric can be cut in half because these countries have such low labor costs that even their cheap wines seem to be palatable somehow.  Also, those Bota boxes are convenient, but I think they taste about as good as two-buck chuck.  Someone told me they are inconsistent so I might give it another try. 

Other Hints:
--  If you take your own bag they will give you a raffle ticket and every week they draw a name for a $25 dollar gift certificate (don't hold me to that price, but it sounds right).  I've been playing this bag game for years at this TJ's and my prior TJ's and have never won.  It makes you realize that if you can't win a simple raffle at the local TJ's you probably shouldn't waste your money on lottery tickets where the odds are really against you.

Flowers and Plants:
-- I've purchased all manner of TJ's flowers and plants over the years and find that they aren't very durable.

If you have to buy flowers in a rush, go for it, but if you need them to stay perky for more than an day, you might go elsewhere.

Hummus?  Arik would be happy to know there are several flavors to choose from.

It is sort of a particular store- not very good for produce- most of it is packaged in way too much plastic and you have to buy in larger quantities.  However, they have 19cent bananas and i often buy bell peppers there.  I won't buy strawberries there as they are almost always have gone off or picked while green and never ripen properly.  

The things that I love about Trader Joe's:

Cheese!  They have the best prices on cheese that I have seen (except for Costco, of course)

Yogurt!  Ohmygod the organic vanilla yogurt is the best yogurt I have ever had.  I often eat it for dessert with some fruit- absolutely heavenly.

Red Thai Curry sauce, dried fruits, salmon roulade, raspberry creme brulee, etc etc

They have so many unique products that are just wonderful, I would cry cry cry if I couldn't go to Trader Joes anymore.

They also have nice succulents in cute pots outside and their flowers are gorgeous and super cheap.  I always look forward to spring when they have daffodils- something like 10 for $2?  Can't beat that.",review,1,ZKo-HD5FdrINIHAcD9AnAA

I almost always give in, and I never regret my choice.

Safeway may have those name brand products that TJ's just hasn't quite replicated yet, but I still enjoy going to TJ's more because of their variety and fresh spin on easy to prepare meals. It's a huge plus that they are so affordable, I never feel ripped off by their prices.

Their frozen seafood section is AWESOME! Frozen bags of sea creatures (huge scallops, shrimp, langosta tails) at half the price of Safeway? I'm soooo in! The seasoned frozen ahi tuna & salmon fillets are ridiculously flavorful, juicy and high quality. Their snack section is also so much fun to peruse through. There's always some new dip or chip to try out. And I love how they have a sample station & wine tastings too!

My Horse Dog adores their peanut butter dog treats. I highly recommend these for other doggie owners as they are decently nutritious and inexpensive. 

The bottom line - their employee's are just so friendly and always cognizant of check-out line lengths & open up more registers instantly if lines get to long. Keep up the good work TJ's, you make grocery shopping fun (which is hard to do in my book).",review,2,w4suxL1zlxsihVlugZZDAQ

This place attracts a wide range people from different lifestyles, backgrounds, ethnicities, creeds, and eccentricities. Just go with it, it's part of the experience and the $2 wine and $3-buck Chuck really help. :) 

YOU MUST TRY: 
1. Mochi! If you've never had it the time has come!! Mochi is overlooked by everyone who's never had exposure to Asian candy and dessert. Ask one of the employees about their Mochi Ice Cream! You'll be glad you did! 
2. Gluten-Free Granola. If you have a sensitivity to gluten, but have a hard time finding snack items that taste good, look no further. Even though I'm not celiac or gluten sensitive I find this treat hard to resist. 
3. Fat-Free Greek Yogurt. Obviously this won't be an option for my lactose-free and vegan friends, but with a little bit of Stevia you can have quite a healthy, weight-concious, and satisfying meal (It takes me half a container to fill me up [blush], you may need less). 
4. Dried Mango slices with Chili. For people not familiar with Central and South American treats, this is gonna sound weird...maybe even blasphemous, but you must sample at least once; I'm sure glad I did! (There are other dried fruits with chili on them too which I also recommend :)

It was Resturant Week and me and my neighbor Sharrita chose to come here for a couple of reasons: Meat and Creme Brulee. What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)

We entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love. 

We had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.  

One slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.

If you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you!

From there on out the service, food and ambiance was outstanding. It far exceeded my expectations from all the wonderful reviews I had read previously. Our waiter, Chad, was very helpful in helping us select items as we were a little overwhelmed by all the good reviews on yelp and the things people have told us personally. Drinks - a gin and tonic for him and a Stoli Doli for me. Appetizer was calamari, which was delicious. He got the 24 ounce porterhouse, which he ate every bit of.

Not as creamy as the microwavable stuff, a little on the soupy side but it was definitely working. We got a creme brulee for dessert, which I discovered upon receiving the check that they comped it for the birthday.

The service is very well worth noting. I'm not big on fluff and getting my rear kissed as a customer, and the service exceeded standard customer service with genuine sincerity without flirting with that rear-kissing fakeness. Although I suspect if you are of that type that appreciates that, they'll do that too. The type of place that folds your napkin whenever you leave the table to use the restroom, but doesn't over-sir or over-madam you. My boyfriend and I are $2 pitcher, jeans and flip flop type diners but the service was welcoming and even though we were out of our usual element, we didn't feel like it.

I even got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how our dinner was!

Robert Carson was our waiter and probably the best waiter I've ever had the pleasure to watch and benefit from!
He treated us like long lost friends.  His long fingers and long hands expertly delivered our plates (and his fingers never touched to top of our plates...we look for that).
He took our photo with the fabulous desert plate before we devoured everything on it!  Best deserts I've had in a long time (Coconut Cream Pie, Chocolate Cake and, my favorite, Cheesecake).
But besides the service and desert, let me praise the beef! All four of us ordered Filet Mignon (one Filet Oscar) and all of us thought it was a prime cut of meat!  The au gratin potatoes (which I haven't eaten in years) was hot, cheesy and wonderful!  Capital Grille ranks up there with Morton's in my book for sure!

The boyfriend and I had date night at Capital Grill last night and also participated in Arizona Restaurant Week. I was excited because they were on the list and only $30. However I wont talk much about the price, as the food was so good, who cares how much is cost. I feel under charged. 

I love the location, the Biltmore is my fave! Easy parking, lovely staff and valet, just great. We parked in the metered lot, but you get 2 hours free with validation, easy. The hostess was just adorable, took us on the scenic route to our table; it was very busy at the time so we were avoiding a large party receiving their entrees. 

The wine list is extensive, anyone can find something they will love. The prices are very good! We got a bottle of the of an Italian red wine $30, it was great! We each started with a salad, a Cesar and a field green salad. I loved the field greens, the dressing on it was just perfect, peppery and light! He loved his Cesar. Then we both picked the fillet for our entree; to die for. First is was cooked exactly as we asked, and practically melted in my mouth. Delish! They came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Both excellent! Couldn't have made them better!

Then..... my favorite part.... dessert! We got one of each to share; Creme Brule and Flour-less Espresso Chocolate Cake. I could literally eat that Creme Brule everyday of my life and it still wouldn't be enough. Amazeballs! The cake was very tasty, but being a flour-less cake is was incredibly rich, very good though!

The service was excellent! Robert, our waiter, was perfect, right on top of everything, not too pushy, and read our table very well. Thank you Robert!

We had a spectacular time. I would recommend them above all for a steak, date night, dessert, anything!",review,5,_uL7OiQSfNsCd60DrAf7qQ

The breakdown:  I would say a good dining experience is the sum of the food, the environment, and the service.

So...the lady and I decided on a whim that the Capital Grille would be the AZ Restaurant pick of the evening. We went after late evening at work...my environment is pretty casual, so I was in t-shirt and shorts. Even on a Tu night it seemed the general atmosphere was business casual.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we came in and appeared no judgments were made. We then waited.  ....and waited.....and waited.  I was beginning to wonder if they didn't like my attire or something.  We noticed it seemed there was a huddle between the wait staff wondering who would take our table. Still no one.  I got up to use the rest room and when I got back my lady said they were bringing out some calamari on the house for our wait.  Sweet!  I generally don't care one anyone the other about calamari...but theirs was really good.  A bit of. A spice, a little kick...but quite tasty.  The waiter was extremely apologetic about our wait and was on top of everything afterwards.  I got the bone in sirloin, lady the filet.  Both were very tasty and cooked to our liking.  The mashed potatoes were delicious...creamy and buttery tasting.  Green beans tasty and crisp.  The espresso chocolate cake dessert...oh my was it rich.  A little chocolate sauce or more raspberry sauce would have been a welcome addition to the dollop of whip cream and raspberries but it was still tasty.. 

But the final action that really put the experience over the top was when the bill was supposed to come and instead the manager said dinner was on them.  They did not want to leave us with a bad experience (esp. considering it was our first time there.). I tried telling him this was unnecessary as they already more than made up for many issues.  They insisted...so the waiter ended up with a pretty good tip out of it.  That was all class though and made me feel quite good about our dining choice. The way they handled things and the food quality even prior to that would have gotten them at least 4 stars.  But the fact they have proven themselves a class act...that puts them over the top.  We will be back.",review,2,NrMU4Qs8qqIZ536buLYQ8w

My Delmonico was absolute perfection, as was the bernaise sauce along with the sides.

My date had the lobster and crab stuffed shrimp, which if you think about it, is the oceanic equivalent of turducken. 
Not that I'd ever eat turducken, but her ordering this dish caused me to rethink my entire value system. Maybe turducken is in my short-term future, who knows. 

Which causes me to wonder why it's ok to stuff a tiny little shrimp with a bevy of other larger crustaceans in the first place. The turkey I get. It's a big motherfucker, capable of stuffing practically any other fowl inside of it. But a shrimp? If anything, they should stuff it with smaller crustaceans, like krill or something.

Anyways, I forgot what I was talking about. Oh yeah, Capital Grille.
There are a lot of older people in here. One old woman in the booth next to ours was coughing up shit all through dinner which really sucked. I turned and gave her the skunk-eye, as if to say; 'Hey bitch, take your phlegmmy-ass outside and let me enjoy my meal', but she shot me a look right back, saying; 'Hey you little wad, I've got more money than anyone in this place and if I so choose, I'll dredge up as much phlegm as I want...now piss off and stop staring at me.'

I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!

Now on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable. 

The steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some. 

Important Notes:

- They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials. 

- During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!

- Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season. 

A special fun fact: 

- I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving. Every day, they give away all the left over food to a local charity, so no food goes to waste!",review,11,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

I went in around 1pm on a weekday and ordered a gyro pita with fries. There were a few other customers at the time and I ended up waiting less than 10 minutes for my order. Not bad. After I placed my order I regretted not getting greek fries, but when my food came I was not disappointed. The fries were excellent how they were and both them and my gyro were fresh. Next time I may get a side of tzatziki only because I like my food a little saucier than it came, but I have no complaints.

not on yelp

the food is authentic ""toi-son"" style southern hillbilly food.

1) foo-guah guy (bitter melon w/chicken)
2) lin-ngah gong (lilly root soup)
3) hom-yee guy-lup chow-fon (salty fish with chicken fried rice)

3) green beans with preserved vegetables
4) steam chicken with ginger/garlic sauce
5) fried chicken wings
6) filet fish with chinese broccoli

If you look at the sign on the building, it says New Hong Kong (kind of confusing when you Yelp it)

If you ask any of the old school chinese who have lived in central phoenix for the past 50 years where to get authentic home style cooking, they know it's at NHK.

If you ask the buffet community where to eat, this place is probably not on the top 100 (disclaimer:  I've never eaten the lunch buffet)

Sadly, it seems that the old school chinese community that patronize this place don't give it the Yelp reviews that it deserves, hence the low ratings.

If you're looking for traditional Cantonese style food, here's a list of semi-authentic stuff I recommend:

1) Beef chow fun
2) Tomato beef over Hong Kong style noodles
3) Fish filet over Gai Lon (Chinese broccoli)
4) Salt/pepper chicken wings (not on the menu)
5) Peking pork chops
6) West lake beef soup
7) X.O. green beans

If you want to go hard core Toi-sahn hillbilly style home cooking like poh-poh and ngain-ngain used to make:

1) Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice)
2) Foo-guah guy, Ow-see (Bitter melon chicken with black been sauce)
3) Gee-ngoke-beng (Steamed pork with preserved salty fish)
4) Hoh-yeow gai-lon (Steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce)
5) Bok-jom-guy (Boiled chicken with garlic and ginger sauce)
6) Muy-choi-kow-yuk (Fatty pork hot-pot with preserved vegetable)
7) Bok choy with black mushroom

They make a raspberry vinaigrette there that deserves it's own paragraph and is mandatory on your dinner salad. 

Another fantastic creation here is the apricot habenero glaze that one would think would over-power a chicken salad, not the case.

i always sat at the bar.  my favorite bartender was cory.  she's a sweetheart.  if you see her, tell her i said hello.  my favorite waitress was serena.  her boyfriend would often come in and he and i would drink and talk.  he was all right.  i met many regulars there and they were all very friendly from the first time i went to my last.  

the owners are twin sisters, heidi and heather.  heather was always so very nice to me.  sometimes, she'd buy me a beer.  that's always cool.  cory would do that, too.  actually, almost every time i went i'd get a beer on the house.   anyway, heather would sometimes sit with me and ask me to try new things.  sometimes it was food and sometimes a new bottle of wine.  

now i don't fit the profile of their average customer.  i have a shaved head, ride a motorcycle and am covered in tattoos from my neck to my writs.  everybody else was pretty white-collar in profession and dress.  still, for some reason, i was accepted and treated very well.  god bless baby kay's.

i see some folks are cajun food snobs but i have to say their crawfish etouffee is really incredible and i can't tell you how many catfish or oyster poboys i ate.  their prices are probably not bad considering the neighborhood, which can be pricey.  as others have noted, it's probably the best cajun food you're going to find in phoenix.

Animal Care Hospital has three practicing DVM's on staff, as well as 4 certified veterinary technicians. All 3 vets are members of the AVMA, AAHA, AzVMA and other organizations. Dr. Bishop is the Hospital Director who started the practice in 1973, Dr. Halver has been there since 1981 and Dr. Temple has been here since 2006. They use isofluorane gas anesthesia, which is the safest anesthesia, especially for toy breeds. They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature. Since almost every dog will be put under at least once to be fixed, it is good to know that they monitor vitals so closely. 

For routine appointments, they schedule a full 30 minutes. Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. 

The vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible. When I asked to deviate from the standard puppy vaccination plan and follow the veterinary protocol recommended by my breeder (a yorkie lover with 20 years experience breeding show and pet yorkies), she was accommodating and even excused herself to go print some info to re-familiarize herself with this particular protocol and permanently place it in Leela's file.",review,2,ivjr8jJ9lKFeDES1DDg0Fg
21838,QEgP-kDuXD2fQJHBm3HoFw,3,2008-08-26,1,VcfG9LIeiZe296tADuEleA,5,"I recently got my little baby pug Penny from a private breeder, so I wanted to take her to a vet and get her checked out. Animal Care Hospital was close to my house, so I figured I would give it a try. 

They were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week.

Anyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!)

I sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the ""puppy package"" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer.

Penny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.)

We went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits.

The only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening.

Oh, another really cool feature is that your pet gets a login and you can keep track of service records through the vet. They have some cool features on the website where you can fill out forms for someone babysitting your pet and you can post pictures and put in information about the diet. I know I lose papers all the time, so its great to have all of Penny's records online where I can easily access them.

They have awesome hours... so I can get in after work, and the location is convenient for me. They also sell different types of food and hygiene supplies there, so you can pick up stuff for your animal should you need to.

I would definitely recommend this Vet's office to anyone. Knowledgeable and Friendly staff!",review,3,MWt24-6bfv_OHLKhwMQ0Tw

The staff was pleasant on the phone and made sure to let me know I'd have to arrive 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork. They checked me in right away and I got to work. The room opened up quickly, so I finished my paperwork in there. Twice an assistant came in to check on Dexter and ask some basic questions.
The vet, Dr. Bishop, was very personable. He set my mind at ease right away. As he finished he said ""He's a very good dog."" Aw!! I know this, and my friends know this, but I like everyone knowing what a great dog he is.
He got a shot, some meds to bring home, and cans of food for the next few days. The entire office visit was just over $100. After some of the other places I've been, this was a welcome relief.

This year, I almost didn't attend because I had a ski accident and was told by the doctor to stay home and rest with my leg elevated before my surgery.
Well, I got bored and decided to do double headers on the last 2 nights before the festival ended.
I was able to call ahead and reserve my tkts ahead of time which was a big time saver.  On my way to the theater, a volunteer saw me walking with crutches and walked with me, held the door open for me and even sat with me through the movie to make sure I would be okay.
In betwn the movie, a volunteer got a chair for me to sit on so I didn't have to walk far while they cleaned the theater in btwn the movies.
The second night was the same.  The volunteers were so nice.  One even adjusted my crutches for me because they were not fitted correctly.  In addition, I sat next to a couple who really empathized with my situation~ the husband had just got done with surgery and rehab.  They told me they would bring me his wheelchair and walker for me to use during recovery and sure enough, the hubby brought it by the other day!
Here I am glowing about the volunteers at the festival and haven't talked about the festival itself.
. . . this festival is a year long planning event completely run by volunteers . . . for this to happen, the festival itself has to have a lot of heart,  And any event that has a lot of heart, has to be good.  
I love movies, I love the Phoenix Film Society, and I love the Phoenix Film Festival.

I have been eating these subs since I was a little kid. My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out. 

Mr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition. 

This place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).

No annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.

They are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.

This place is special to regulars and those in the know can tell you they dont have to have special breads, or a wall full of different subs to impress.

Try a meatball sub, the meatballs are great. Especially on Plain WHITE bread. I dont come here for the 10 types of bread or the 50 different sandwiches. This place is old school, and that's what I love about it. Rudy and Gloria are always fantastic. I drive out of my way to eat here. I live in the SW valley to trek up to 24th St and Osborn.

My car is. Right after Perry and his team has spent the entire day detailing it.

When I bought a black car, I knew I was in for some high maintenance. But it wasn't until a good friend of mine who's a paint/body specialist referred me to Perry and European Detail after some acidic water leaked on my car after someone power washed the top level of my parking garage. 

I thought my paint was ruined for sure! I took it to European Detail (at that time, they were located on Indian School) and not only did they get the acid off, they suggested a GLARE product to protect my paint from further episodes...even bird droppings! The product is amazing and my car looked better than it did brand now. It removed all the small swirl marks/scratches. So from that point forward, I frequented European Detail for basic washes.

When they moved their location up to the Scottsdale Airpark, I didn't visit as often.  I hit up a few hand wash places here and there in-between my visits to European...but nothing compares (to you!). It wasn't until recently that my car turned 1yr old, and I treated her to a spa day with a full detail. I am a perfectionist to the core, but I think I found my match with these guys. I couldn't find one thing that was missed or annoying. They treated my leather, steamed carpets, engine, you name it. But the difference between European and others is that there was no chemical smell, my seats/floors weren't soaking wet needing to dry (they use the most amazing techniques and products)...I drove away in heaven.

BOTTOM LINE: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

I know that Craig Jackson uses European Detail and trusts Perry and his team to keep his cars in top notch shape, that alone speaks a million words. The knowledge of detailing for the team is an art form, not a quick wash/in-out situation.

Shockingly, it's only slightly higher in price than what I've paid previously at these corner ""hand-wash"" places but the results are 1,000 better.

My vehicle is not only an investment, but I am proud of it. And when I drive away from European Detail I have no doubt I have even more to be proud of because I got the best service and Auto Detail in the Valley. 

Which reminds me, I need to frequent for in-between washes as well - not just details. Thanks for the great service Perry and Team!",review,2,jy1qPe0Tz3ewHacAtshmBw

We ordered the escargot, which was very tender and delicious and had a very authentic, rich flavour. The smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side. 

The most amazing dish we sampled was the Noisettes de boeuf, which is essentially small tender pieces of beef wrapped in very lean bacon in a Dijon mustard sauce. This was seriously the most amazing beef that I've ever had and I'm typically not a steak person. We ended up ordering a second helping of it since it was really that good!

We finished off the night with a delectable Creme Brulee and it brought me back to my days living in France. It was the perfect ending to an incredible meal.

The owner of the restaurant is extremely friendly and sat down at the bar to chat with us for a while. The bistro has a very warm and inviting atmosphere and the patio is beautiful at night. This place isn't snobby like a lot of French restaurants and the staff is very responsive.

We ended up spending about $100 between the drinks and 4 appetizers (BTW - the Mango Martini is to die for!) but the whole experience was really worth it.

Went here tonight after writing strip club reviews all day which sparked a debate among my friends - we decided to check it out since none of us had been here before. And why the fuck haven't we?? 

I'm pretty picky and I'll just say that every girl in here is good looking and has a good body. Even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town. Many of them are downright beautiful.

Cover was 8 bucks, there wasn't a drink minimum (but drinks were as pricey as any other club) and dances were 10 bucks... VIP was 20 bucks and wasn't terribly private, but it was nice. My girlfriend got some good dances and we spent our 80 bucks so quick we had to make another run to the ATM before we had even been there an hour. 

The place has 3 stages and the girls have to rotate to all three which keeps them from being available for awhile and that's kind of a bummer. It's nice though because there's always something to look at. There are a LOT of girls here too, so you won't be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance. I was told that the management here was great too and most of the girls I talked to had worked at other clubs but found this one to be the best by far. 

This place is a little more laid back than other clubs... the girls don't go crazy with the pole dancing - guess when you're hot you don't have to. At first I thought they were just looking bored, but when they come around to chat they light up. This place is more about mingling than watching a show.

I would browse every now and again and marvel at the array of products.  Back then, I would never really buy anything, but I would promise myself that I could have whatever I wanted once I renovated my kitchen.  It took me a long time to achieve that goal, but eventually I did.  Then the flirtation blossomed into my first purchase.  My torrid affair with Williams-Sonoma has been raging for a couple of years now.

In Phoenix, the Biltmore Fashion Park store is my favorite Williams-Sonoma location.  The one at the Fashion Square is okay, but it feels cramped.  I travel for business and I seek out Williams-Sonoma stores on the road.  The one in Oak Brook (suburban Chicago) is nice.  The store in Walnut Creek, CA is also nice.  The new flagship in Union Square in San Francisco is like Williams-Sonoma Mecca!  It's four floors of everything Williams-Sonoma carries as well as artifacts from Chuck Williams' own kitchen.  It's like a Williams-Sonoma museum combined with the entire product line.  As a side note, the original Williams-Sonoma store that was on the square in Sonoma has been closed.  The Union Square store replaced it.

Williams-Sonoma is the best!  The products are all of the finest quality and they stand by everything they sell.  If you ever have a problem, they will take the item back with no questions asked and give you store credit if you don't have your receipt.    
I've bought everything at Williams-Sonoma from my Le Creuset Doufeu to Fleur de Sel French sea salt.  If you love to cook, this is the place for you.  If you bake or cook a lot, be sure to check out their All-Clad Stainless Steel Measuring Cups & Spoons.  The measuring cups are adorable because they're miniature versions of the All-Clad saucepan.  For standard measures, they offer sets of both four cups and spoons: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup; 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp and 1 Tbs.  The really handy items are the odd-size sets.  They offer sets of both cups and spoons in the following odd sizes: 2/3 cup, 3/4 cup and 1 1/2 cups; 2 tsp, 1 1/2 Tbs and 2 Tbs.  All the spoons stack together into a cute space-saving group.  All four sets of measures make an awesome gift!

Don't overlook their website.  Sometimes they will have Special Offers for products online that can be upwards of 50% off of the same items in the stores.  This drives the BF a bit crazy because he thinks their pricing should be consistent across all retail channels, but I'm willing to check their website frequently as I have found a number of bargains online.",review,3,QrOSr8bzAjpIgyNftDLUBg

After spending a whopping ten bucks on two original photos I decided that I needed some custom framing done. Thanks to Yelp I found Framin' Works. 

The shop itself is a large open space with many works in progress. Alan, the proprietor, clearly knows his business. I explained what I had in mind and in no time at all I had several samples laid out. It was a painless process. I left with the understanding that he'd call when my frames were done. 

Several weeks later I got a very apologetic call from Alan. It would seem that while he was on vacation some of the workload fell behind. It wasn't a big deal and my photos were beautifully framed.

This is the only Greek Orthodox monastery in North America and founded by a living saint, Father Ephraim. I drove from Los Angeles, but people come from all over the world to stay as a pilgrim at this monastery. The 45 or so monks living here run a tight ship keeping the holly grounds in tip top shape. It's immaculate, with lush gardens, fountains, and gazebos. They've turned the place into an oasis in the middle of a hot ,dry cacti ridden desert. 

There are several chapels within the monastery and one major church where most of the magic takes place. Most of the furniture and icons are brought in from Mt. Athos, considered one of the most holly places for Greek Orthodoxies. Sadly, no women are allowed on Mt. Athos. But that's besides the point. Women must wear long skirts and wear a mandili or scarf to cover their hair, basically do not show any skin. Men must wear long sleeve shirts and pants. 

You can visit for the day or stay overnight as a pilgrim. If you are a pilgrim you can stay from 1 -10 days. You must attend all services, which means the big one from 1:45 AM to 4:00 AM every night. The first night I went at 1 AM and was able to kiss Father Ephraim's hand. After the night morning service, there is a breakfast of freshly baked bread (the monks bake like crazy), large and small bitter green olives from the olive orchards grown on the grounds, 2 types of halva, jam, nuts, fresh fruit from their orchards and coffee. This is a typical fasting breakfast (no animal products). After breakfast you go back to bed for another 3 hours of quiet time. Walking back to my room at 5 AM was beautiful. The desert stars and moon are bright, casting shadows on the cacti and the air is cool and fresh. In the day you are pretty much free to roam. Lunch is served at 11:30 AM and there is no talking aloud, except for a monk reading a chosen bible passage in Greek. When they ring the bell, you are allowed to pour water. A typical fasting lunch that I had consisted of braised green beans with calamari, fresh bread, olive, salad, and Greek macaroni. After lunch you can try to get a blessing from Father Ephraim, go to the book store, talk to some monks or other pilgrims. Another mandatory service is Vespers at 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM and afterwards dinner is served. After dinner is the last mandatory service. And then you are ready to go to bed at 7:30. No joke. I fell asleep before quiet hours even - I was feeling extremely peaceful and happy, yet exhausted. 

I will be back to the monastery with my dad. I was lucky to stay two nights with profoundly holly people and have an incredible experience.",review,12,kuEKOd7JEnDun43SUsjJ7w

I had very respectable clothing (pants, long sleeve shirt), but they required women's head to be covered and a skirt to be worn, so they were kind enough to lend us elastic skirts that I just put over my pants.. and I found a scarf in the car - presto, ready to go!

The staff there is very friendly in the gift shop and they have wonderful treats and gourmet items for sale that are made from the gardens there and made by the ladies and gentlemen living a monastic life there... got some wonderful tea and delicious baked goods.

My husband and I have this ""new"" tradition of giving each other a bunch of different cupcakes for each other's birthday instead of a whole birthday cake. That way we can each try a variety. 

After reading the reviews and knowing how close Barb's is, I decided to try them out. 

First of all, apologies for not taking pictures of the bakery display -- I guess that gives me another excuse to visit them. But.... there were so many different types of cupcakes. Probably around a dozen different kinds. Nearly all of them were only $1.75 each. Yup, that's right -- $1.75 each!! The ""special"" ones were still only $2.25 each. 

I grabbed an assortment.... carrot cake, red velvet, cosmo, white w/ sprinkles, a petit four, and a coconut donut. 

The coconut-topped donut was my treat on the short car-ride home. It was pretty good. 

But later on, when I gave them to my husband we tried the carrot cake cupcake first. OMG!! Seriously, I think it was the BEST carrot cake concoction I have ever had. Seriously soo good... and the frosting was awesome too. 

Then the Cosmo - another OMG moment. Sooo good... loved the cranberry frosting filling inside. (i think?)

Petit Four... OMG! Perfect... the cake was still so moist inside. Loved the frosting. 

Red Velvet -- my husband prefaced w/ he knew that I must've gotten that one for myself since he's not a huge fan; but... when he tried it, he said it's the first Red Velvet that he's liked. Soo good!

And the white one w/ sprinkles -- well, ahhh.. my husband never saw that one. I had to ""research"" the cakes when I got home. But if he happens to read this review some day........ ""Sorry!"" (voice of Gilly)

Barb's is an adorable bakery with a storefront full of everything from cupcakes and pastries to donuts and cookies. But it's her cake that gets her the five stars in my book. My youngest nephew (2 months) just celebrated his baptism and so of course that called for a celebration. I told my sister about Barb's so she grabbed the cake from there and brought it to the party. I could have started and ended with just the cake it was so good. 

The cake was the perfect size for our group and they did a wonderful job of decorating it in honor of the baptism with white and blue frosting, his name, date and blue crosses. It was a three layer chocolate with vanilla frosting cake. I originally asked for a sliver but when I saw how delicious it looked, I opted for a normal size piece instead.

It's always cold and fresh with no other flavors absorbed in the butter.  The salads are all fantastic!  So fresh!  I've had every side dish and I love them all.  The desserts and dessert wines are perfect.  All of the wines are great too.  Shirley Temples are so nice.  

I've always had excellent service at the Camelback location.  (One in Vegas had slow service but they were very busy and I think understaffed and Scottsdale location was just alright - not as attentive as Camelback location)

Yes, it is expensive.  We expect that when we go.  I think it is VERY much worth it though.  They have the right to serve ala carte.  The prices aren't outrageous.  The food is very, very good.  The sides are the perfect size.  

I also like the way they wrap the leftovers to go in nice boxes and bags.   

To comment on a few of the other postings here...the servers tell you the plate is sizzling hot.  They even ask you to raise your napkin over your chest as they set it down.  The guy who burned his hand should have been warned.  Sorry if he wasn't.  And the butter is what makes it so special and wonderful.  The servers tell you that it comes with the butter.  It is not swimming.  They put a little pad on the top at the last moment and that hot plate keeps your steak hot.  As for people who have had bad service and wrong steaks, that is not the norm.  

I have never had a better rib eye.  We try to do it like Ruth's at home, but it's never quite the same.  Never had any of their other steaks.  I also recommend the stuffed chicken.  Oh my!  Again on the chicken, the butter and sizzling makes it AWESOME!",review,2,pVDAcUrUBTz9RGselQfofg

Kaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance. 

And I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road. 

Whether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business.",review,3,LP8JFPcEtA0ti8g_BRBX4w

As my yelping abilities have matured, however, I have adopted a more holistic method for my reviews.  Ambiance, originality, and service are now major considerations as well.  And albeit a rare occurrence, the service here has earned Hillstone Stewart K.'s coveted 5 stars.

Now don't misunderstand the food here is exquisite.  Hillstone stated that it emphasizes local produce to comprise its dishes.  I am all for this, not for environmental reasons (which I couldn't care less about), but rather practicality.  Local food tastes fresher because it generally is.  The ""Nice"" salad proved this point as it tasted fresh and ""green"".  You know that new plant taste that food picked fresh from the field has?  This was especially apparent in the walnuts in the salad which had the imbued flavors of the shell still on it (without the crunchiness of course).  

Ah, but here is where Hillstone's, or rather its server Becca, exceptional service points come in.  I was unsure of what entree to get here.  I asked our waitress for her recommendations.  I expected the usual spiel about how the server coincidentally thinks that the most expensive item on the menu is the best tasting.  Not so with Becca, she recommended the $28 ribs or even the burger.  Both are items that are on the cheaper end of Hillstone's offerings.  So despite how quickly, and almost artificially, she seemed to be able to rattle off the recommendations, she quickly gained my trust and passed my test.

But alas, I had ribs earlier in the day.  I opted for the $35 Hawaiian Ribeye.  It came out cooked perfectly medium rare (red with warm center), but a tad sweeter than I had imagined since it was glazed in something akin to pineapple something or other.  When Becca came by the table and asked, ""How is your meal?""  I answered exactly as I mentioned above.  I guess my Northeastern bluntness may come across as a bit brash around these parts, but I was being honest and I did say that I enjoyed my meal.  But Becca seemed concerned though, like it was her mission to right some great injustice that Hillstone's chef committed against me.  Again, I assured her the steak was good.  So I rounded off my meal with the brownie in a cream sauce that was good enough to drink but decadent enough to make me sick and a coffee.    

So throughout my experience here, my waitress thoroughly explained each menu item from the Lux coffee (a local coffee roaster) to practically every entree on the menu, with an patience and positive attitude that I'm frankly just not used to back home.  In addition, at no point did my  water or coffee ever reach empty nor ever leave my table for want of anything...but here was the real gem for the evening.  Despite my fleeting, obtuse comment about the ribeye being ""too sweet"", she removed it from the bill!  I assured Becca that I was genuinely satisfied with the meal, but she stopped me and replied, ""I want you to be completely satisfied with your experience here.""  Then she said something to the effect that if I wasn't completely satisfied, I ought not pay. ....NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF SERVICE THAT TRULY DEMONSTRATES GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THE CUSTOMER.  So what I would consider about a 3.5 to 4 star meal, has become a 5 star experience.  If I am in the area in the future, I will return and would hope that this level of dedication to customer satisfaction is adhered to by all at Hillstone.",review,5,0GNkaqOGywvuU-JSrScrMw

The only reason I could see coming here is to have some Apple product fixed, which has also only happened to me once. I mean my iPods have had their series of strange fits, including my new iPod always crashing for some reason whenever it plays an ELO song. I can't decide if it hates ELO or if its prog-rock power completely blows its mind.

But I digress. My powerbook indeed did have a real problem when its Hard Drive appeared to flat out die. I go online and see you can make a reservation at the ""Genius Bar"", which seemed lame but I did it anyway.

I show up about 10 minutes before my appointment and one of the Geniuses starts calling out names, but since none of them are there I get to go early. This friendly (and in actuality, pretty smart guy) then spends around 30 minutes with my power book trying to see if he can do anything to get the HD back in working order as well as examining the laptop to see if anything else is wrong with it. 

He passed down the unfortunate verdict that my HD was deceased and needed to be replaced and that nothing else seemed wrong with my powerbook. He looked up how much it would cost because I didn't have a warranty on the powerbook. (People have warranties on Apple Products?) He came up with a pricey number that I almost considered for a second, but before I could respond he told me that would be dumb to pay. He gave me a card for a Mac store that would be much cheaper. He then also gave me a card to what was according to him the best data recovery store in the city. He then sent me on my merry way completely free of charge.

I used to work at a service desk for a Gateway Country back in the day and I would have been fired for telling a customer to go somewhere else for cheaper. Here they seem to encourage it with stacks of business cards at the Genius bar. I also wouldn't/couldn't spend 2 minutes with a customer with a broken computer. Or do anything for free. And even for a fee there was no service there or at most big box stores to work through problems side-by-side with a customer.

This experience was a first for me in my history of shopping at a large corporations store. I'm not sure what is going wrong with all the other trips reported here (or why people are buying things at a store), but I was completely dumbfounded at how helpful and free the service is at this store just because I bought a product from their corporation.",review,3,eBFm-lABQiKpaUcPDfYOgA

Calls and texts were coming in, but I couldn't get to 'em. Now, I'm not saying I dropped it shortly before it went haywire - because that might have voided the warranty, and besides, it could have gone haywire without being dropped - but I'm not saying I didn't either, if you know what I mean. 

Well, since I couldn't exactly call for help, I went online and made an appointment for the genius bar. This was around 3pm, I guess. Earliest appointment was for 7:20. I showed up at 7:10, checked in, got called at 7:15. Walked out of the the store with a brand new iPhone at 7:25. A brand new iPhone in 15 minutes!

so boom it fires up for the first time and i see it. a black triangle of burned out LEDs WHOA!!! no fun. panic was released and calm restored. it's 2 weeks old, i'll take it to an Apple store for a replacement.

so Saturday morning i made an appointment at the Genius bar to have them look at it, and hopefully say, ""We'll just replace it for you""....

well after an interesting turn of events on the light rail, i showed up late, only 15 minutes. but my reservation was already voided..my fault. no biggie.

i tell the guy at the genius bar check in what the deal is and he says, we can put you back in the queue and one of the genius can look at it.

i said ""is there a way we can just get an exchange, i don't really want to hear that it would need to be shipped off to wherever to be fixed"" he said sure, but they might have the parts there to fix it, and that the online stock and the in-store stock are different, so he might not be able to exchange but would go check into it....15 minutes later he walked out of the room behind the genius bar with another monitor. i walked over to the exclusive register since they switched over to the mobile point of sales set up. after a couple bar code scans i was walking out the store with a new monitor. a new monitor without burned out LEDs that is. 

i was happy.

What began the night before as a ominous, frightening clicking inside of my laptop, progressed the next morning into nothing but a flashing folder with a question mark on it. 

I was greeted instantly and was cheerily asked what I had come into the store for. I frantically explained what was going on with my MacBook, and I could tell by the fallen face of the greeter that my inclinations were unfortunately right on the money. He set up an appointment for me with a Genius for 30 minutes in the future- during which time I finally got around to looking at those pesky external hard drives! (Too little too late I fear)

I came back and only had to wait a few minutes to be helped by my assigned Genius. My story garnered the same reaction as the concierge, and all was confirmed when Genius couldn't even detect the existence of my hard drive. Everything and anything was gone and I was completely devastated. Genius was extremely sympathetic and assured me that my AppleCare would cover the hard drive and that he could take care of it and I would be all set back up within 20 minutes. 

As I waited, I wandered around the store and was asked a few more times if I needed any assistance by several friendly associates. When I went back to check the status, I mentioned that my trackpad had been wearing down after years of use, and how I would go about replacing it. Genius said, no prob, that he had it in stock and would swap it out. What I didn't realize was it was one part so I also got a new keyboard in the mix, so that was pretty sweet. 

Now, I think Genius felt sorry for me to be honest. I'm not sure, but I really don't think the keyboard part, nor the battery are covered under AppleCare in normal circumstances, but that day apparently they were. 

So I walked out of Apple with a practically new MacBook, finally that damn external hard drive, but no evidence of the last 3 years of my life. It was a super crappy day, but it could have been a lot worse. Thanks to Genius Alan and AppleCare, I was at least able to have a silver lining to the dark cumulonimbus hovering over my head.

My cousin had the gyro pita, which was melt in your mouth delicious too.  We also shared a spanekopita, which was just so fresh and well made.  It was piping hot food, she cooked to order (hold the onions for me!), and the flavors were perfect. 

The portions were great, the hummus was tasty, the pita so soft and perfectly grilled.  The Olympic Flame has even mastered the use of garlic, which many restaurants seem not to be able to manage.

Service
Jodi -  The General Manager, Fabulous!
Alex - I believe that was my main waiters name- great guy but the other guys who brought out my food, filled my tea, and just came to check on my on a regular basis were so great and very thoughtful. I guess they don't get very many ladies dining alone :)

Food
Warm Croissants - YUMMY! So very good.

First Course -
Ratatouille Tart with Parmesan Crisps & Black Olive Tapenade - Light and fluffy with lots of veggies. Came with a small salad that was pretty tasty as well. Olive Tapenade is always a little salty regardless of who makes it however this one was not as salty as most. Very good.

Second Course-
Duck Confit with Citrus Sauce - YUM! Cooked to perfection and the sauce was just right. Also came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes, a couple of veggies. Only ate half as I wanted to make sure I saved room for dessert. So needless to say I have enough for dinner tomorrow night. They even packed in a few extra of those mouth water croissants. Double kudos for that.

Third course -
Warm Chocolate Tarts with Fresh Whipped Cream - SINFUL! Seriously mine came out nice and warm, fresh from the oven with a nice dollop freshly made whipped cream. So very good indeed.

I must say that dining alone has its perks. I got to people watch, even watched a proposal (she did say yes by the way) and the staff were really nice and very attentive. I will definitely have to visit them again soon.",review,4,4E_nPWw89FLFHdNsEgMH-g

No... we need to go out and relax on Boxing day and have more food, better food...with sauces!  Needless to say, women rule the world.

Anyway on a evening expected to be quiet, 8 of us were treated to the private stone room.

I am always amazed by Vincent.  The man is a work-a-holic, running the restaurant, catering and then seemingly throwing in the Saturday bazaar just so he does not have a moment off.

Our group is known at Vincent's and Howie is possibly the most informed wine waiter in the valley.  He is just terrific as was the service in general.  Mr. Wine, who was not THE Mr. Wine this evening (we had a big gun with us), enjoyed a aged Bordeaux and a Chilean Cab.

Mrs. Foodie ordered her usual collection of dishes and found them all great.  The Salmon quessadilla  was remarkable and is just great with Chardonnay.  My grouper was perfectly cooked.

But the Rack...the Rack.  You know how at some places you go and get 3 or 4 little pieces for like $100 (OK, not that much, but still a lot)?  At Vincent's you get 9 wonderful, juicy pieces of perfectly cooked Lamb with lots of extra stuff.  Three (if I had them) thumbs up.

Then dessert comes, and comes and comes.  We enjoy good Sauternes and, as is Vincent's habit (he just sends a bunch out), ALL the desserts were just yummy.   

Normally we have heard from Mrs. Ambiance by now, however in the private room on a quiet night there was not much for her to judge.  I will report two things, one, although the place was relatively empty, there was a lounge lizard singing and a crowd of hip youngsters sitting around enjoying cocktails.  Very cool.  And. two, Mr. Vincent himself directed me to the WR (the guy does not rest).

If you need a big time formal retox, Vincent's is the way to go.  Speaking of which, after tiring myself out at Squash with another Yelper, and then climbing Squaw Peak (are you nuts? yes!)

I had the mini brioche sliders ($8). You get to choose 3. I went with the crab cake, lamb and beef. I don't think I would get the lamb again, but the other two were adorable, satisfactory nuggets! (They are indeed mini.) 

As for my cocktail selection, I started with the champagne with  bigarade liqueur (Orange liqueur from Provence: it tasted like a perfectly balanced mimosa with no calories wasted on juice! ;)) but also enjoyed the malbec and tried the cava (it was too sweet for me).

Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. 

I've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. 

When I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think ""oh yikes, here comes a pricey night,"" but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. 

Vincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's.",review,10,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

The atmosphere is very cozy, and has a great euro feel to it. What I was most impressed with was the service. Our waiter was very knowledgable and patient.

We dropped in for a late breakfast and as soon as we chose our table, they brought us mini croissants and strawberry preserves that were quite lovely.  I ordered an asparagus quiche that was golden brown on top.   The eggs were done perfectly and I believe there were some sundried tomatoes in it. Accompanying it was a salad of tossed greens with light vinaigrette which was heavenly.

My brother ordered the cheese & fruit plate which he said was delicious.  The thin little slices of bread were toasted to perfection and he was pleased with the overall arrangement.

We got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.

We started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entrées, the ladies ordered Sautéed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!

One of the soups of the evening was called Chilled Heirloom Tomato Soup. It consisted of not one NOT TWO but THREE small dishes of different high end Heirloom tomatoes Red, Yellow and Orange.  Each soup was chilled and each soup was very velvety but each one was seasoned in a different way. That was certainly a BIG WOW for only $6.00.

My husband ordered off the menu and had the Three Cheese Tartine. It's like a French open Faced Garlic Bread with Melted Cheeses and Pesto. They were very yummy and the plate came with a generous fresh mixed green salad. ($9.50)

I had the Rainbow Trout special ($13.00). The moist fresh tasting trout came topped with rich beurre blanc sauce sprinkled with fresh basil and chives. The portion of fish was small I am guessing about three ounces but was enough with everything. I picked the fresh mixed greens as my side dish but the other choices were potatoes or rice. 

My husband had the Duck Confit that came with bacon laced lentils ($16.00 the highest price menu item) He said it was the BEST DUCK he ever had and other places were we paid twice as much or more haven't made duck as delicious,  moist, flavorful and with a crispy perfect skin to boot too!

When I emailed my prescription company, they told me this was possible if the doctor's office called it in. However, my doctor's assistant tried several times and got nowhere. Today I was there with her and she patiently tried one last time and made sure my prescription went through as requested.

I haven't had a primary in over 2 years I think and need a referral to an ENT so I decided that I needed to develop a relationship with a Dr. and maintain it since I plan on being here for a while.

The facility is right down the street from my house so nice and convenient. It is HUGE but they have a map at the entrance of the parking lot. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the girls at the front desk. They promptly take your information and have you sign the remaining paperwork if you didn't finish it online. You then wait for another lady to take your co-pay. From what it seems this office runs like a well oiled machine, but I thought it was interesting that the woman was copying the co-pays on paper in an old fashioned receipt book. It didn't take long, so I don't really care, I just would have figured since they have online technology for their patients that they would have something for themselves.

Anyway, a nurse came and got me and did the whole vitals thing and checked height and weight and what not and then I was placed in a room to wait for Dr. Bauer. It took her about 5 minutes and she was in and introducing herself, reviewing my paperwork and talking to me about me. She was really nice and straightforward which I liked - down to business. Please don't take it for her being impersonal because it isn't, shes a busy doctor and wants to give you the best focus she can and I like that.

She checked me out and everything was fine as I knew and she also quickly gave me a referral for an ENT in the same building and had me request my old records. For a first time visit, this only took 45 minutes which was less than I was expecting.

The occasional whack of the puck hitting the glass tends to startle even the guy with the biggest bar tab into a moment of sobriety.  Or if you're me you just spill a bit of beer down your shirt and hope you aren't sipping it the next time a puck bangs into the glass :)

ANYWAYS... 5 flat screens on which HOCKEY GAMES get precedence.... imagine that!! one of them usually has a basketball game or something else on but i've never seen a bartender be anything but accommodating (though usually the most popular game as decided by amount of viewers gets sound preference). on that note, all the bartenders are super friendly and personable.

Even with the help of the trustee Yelp app, we still drove around and around the shopping center, only to finally see the glimpse of a sign out of the corner of our eyes. With a couple turns, we came to the back parking lot where the sign welcomed us inside. 

It might be hidden now, but I learned that the Ice House Tavern has been around since the early 1960's...during the era when the ice rink was in the middle of a booming mall and a center attraction. I can only imagine how popular the Ice House Tavern was during those days. Although the mall is long gone, the Ice House Tavern survives and serves as a memory of what Phoenix used to be and it's a very cool memory at that. I just wish the mall was still there. How cool would it be to have a skating rink in the middle of a shopping mall!

I must admit, we were a little nervous parking in a secluded back parking lot and walking into a windowless bar, but we had been reading about this bar for years and had to check it out! The moment we walked in, we knew we'd made a good choice! The very friendly and knowledgeable bartender welcomed us inside while two old timers sat at the bar and started to chat with us. Now as the other reviews say, the very coolest part about this bar is the fact that the bar's back wall is actually the window looking out onto the ice rink! We happened to stop by during the men's league championship hockey game so we got to watch a hockey game while we enjoyed a drink! 

Speaking of drinks, who would have thought that this was a bar for a beer aficionado! The bartender handed us a thick binder that listed pages of beer and then the description of the beer. They have several different unique beers here and the bartender knows each one! I also enjoyed the food menu. It's simple. It's one item. When we were there, they were featuring a pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty! It was pecan smoked meat and had a sweet BBQ flavor to it. 

Everything about this bar is vintage, casual and friendly. It's truly a neighborhood bar and although we were first timers, we felt like family by the time we left. Besides watching people ice skating, they also have games including Big Buck Hunt.

As described previously, finding this dive bar is a hunt. Trust me, YOU CAN DO IT! You should do it. Where else can you pick from a huge beer list and watch hockey? I don't even like hockey  (Sorry everyone :) and found the experience awesome.

You can saddle up to the bar, which provides an eyeball view of the action, or go up a level and look out. Last night there was even a band! (The Leavehers rocked!)

RIght, so where is this bar? In the strip mall that's stage left to Walmart. Drive around to the back, keep driving, and eventually you'll see what looks to be a loading dock area. Up high are two signs that don't particularly look legit. (They're not actually formal building signs, but plastic banners you might see on a fence. No joke.) 

The door has a tiny awning and there aren't any windows that let you see into the bar. (Just two stop signs stating ""21 and over"".) YOU HAVE ARRIVED! 

No matter who you are be ready to show ID. 
(Don't be flattered ladies. I was, but alas, for no reason :)

The beer menu is incredible. I focused on the Porter section. (Porters have their own section!). By looking at microscopic print (or maybe I should get old lady glasses) I learned they have some items on a seasonal basis, or rarely. For this reason I hopped on down to the bar and asked the bartender for guidance. The bartender is SUPER NICE. I love her.

FOOD? They serve one hot sandwich. Super deal at $6.75 (that pice includes taxes)! There are also chips (Doritos, etc.) and they have hot popcorn.

They also had a few beers on tap. You can pick up a small pitcher for $6!

MUSIC? The jukebox is free! How so? They feature local bands only. I think this is wonderful. Music all night (after the band finished their set) and no need to continuously plug a machine with stripper dollar bills. (What? I've never been to a stripper club!)

The essence of smoked meat and charcuterie permeates the interior. Reminds me of the smell of the meat section on the sixth floor of KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens) in Berlin.

They offer quite a selection of house-made sausage and specialties here. It all looked a bit pricey, so I have not sampled their wursts yet. I have, however, done some great stocking stuffer shopping here--they have a good selection of German grocery items. I was thrilled to find their display of Kinder Schokolade-Überraschungseier (chidren's chocolate surprise eggs). Everybody (including adults) appreciates the complexity of the prizes you find inside these eggs. Maybe it's because of superior German engineering, but Cracker Jack ought to be ashamed of the prizes they offer when compared to these! The eggs were pricey though... $2.50 a pop (but worth it for the novelty).

I also found myself impulse shopping for German candy Ahoj-Brause (basically fizzing pixie stick dust), mustard-in-a-tube, and Knorr seasonings. With all my Christmas stocking stuffer needs met, I was lucky to get out the door without buying too much more.

It is now has the third highest sales of any Tuesday Morning stores in Arizona while being the smallest.  (I asked)  To accomplish that a store has to be fairly well organized with good service.  I consider this store to be a real gem!  I don't have to pay the prices of Fashion Square or the Biltmore or deal with it takes to find a parking place there either. (Don't get me wrong, I like both of those places as well, I use them just for point of comparison.) Nine times out of ten i can go in there, find what I want and get out if I want to.  The problem is I usually look around a bit and go home with maybe a bit more than I expected.

Obviously in a store that carries as man better name close outs in as small a place as it is, one does have to keep a sharp eye out, and maybe do a little digging.  Who cares, treasure is to be found.  I have found this store to be infectious.  Every time I go there I seem to find a better price on something than the time before. Be it something for the yard, gifts for the kids, entirely to expensive sheets for the bed, crystal, monogrammed thank you note's, something for the my cat, Picasso, they are all there and waiting..  I took a friend there the other day who complained they didn't have prices like Goodwill.  The truth is this person is not a shopper and never will be.  If you are a shopper, you'll recognize the quality is at prices that make sense. 

Another minor but really nice thing about the Tuesday Morning stores is the music they play when you are there.  At major dept stores you hear music that has been selected by a team to maximize sales according to critical factors.  The owner of Tuesday Morning picks the music you listen to.  I like his taste and usually find myself humming a tune at some time before I leave which is usually with more than I planned on.

I will talk about the service which is unique to this store.  Depending on the lines of customers waiting to be rung up, they may or may not greet you as you come in.  Usually I find they do.  If you just aren't finding what you are looking for, you might have to to be the one to seek out  one of their people and ask them concerning what you are looking for.  At this point, I am usually very afraid.   They are going to steer me to an area where even if I don't see what I asked for, something will be there that will work.  I just have to decide which or how many!

I haven't discussed the wonderful yellow Clearance signs have I?   I look at prices that really can't be beat on things that I probably will use for some thing  at some time.  If I can't see why they are marked down, or there is a flaw that I can live with,  I have this good habit of buying them.  The result is I never really have to shop for the holiday, birthdays or you name it.  I  dig in the back of my hall closet closet and usually something is there that will suffice.  Tuesday Morning is truly one of the stores that helps keep that closet well stocked.

There was a good crowd out for this event, 25 or 30 of us, including people who are as totally into birds as I am into buffets (can you imagine?), & newbies such as myself.  Our friendly & VERY knowledgeable guide, Emily Morris, made it really fun for everyone, as we walked up & down both sides of the river a ways, & off on some nearby trails, with the idea being to see how many birds we could spot.  By the time it was over, we had seen around 40 different kinds!  There are lots of other wild animals out there too!  Did you know that there are BEAVERS in the river, for instance?

Ol' Rio Salado itself cooperated very well, too.  It gets pretty narrow in the summer by my house, but it was roaring for this outing, & what fun this whole thing turned out to be!  Our tour lasted about 3 1/2 hours, but someone could leave early if they needed to, it's all free.  The Center even loans you binoculars if you don't have your own.

BTW, if I can just digress for a moment...I see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected to...this particular morning was no different...an 85 year old, Grandpa Jones look alike, standing naked at one of the sinks, one leg up on the counter and shaving ""himself"" in places that I had trouble believing that anyone other him would care about...you just can't ""un-see"" that kind of thing:(

If that describes you...please, for the love of god...go into a shower stall or something...I was blinded from seeing this and I spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along, asking for someone to just put me out of my misery, before I managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myself:)

Anyway...I still needed a haircut...(or, I needed to reform my band from 1970...we played a very ragged version of ""House of the Rising Sun""...and that's about all we played:)

These days, my choice for sartorial reconstruction is V's Barber Shop...I used to go to Great Clips, but V's  has won me back and won me back for good:)

This location is everything I want in a great barber shop...a manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a ""salon"":)

Nowhere near enough testosterone in any salon...even the unisex Super Clips and Great Cut's:)

That's not the case at V's...it's all testosterone, all the time:)

The barbers are all barbers...they may be stylists too, but first and foremost, they are barbers...they know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers I used to frequent in San Francisco and Portland.

Lots of sports to talk about (and flat panel TV's with ESPN on at every station), plenty of magazines to read while I'm waiting for my call to action (and not a Cosmo or Vogue in sight:) and tons of wood paneling and manly smells (I mean witch hazel, talcum powder, etc....not ""pull my finger"" manly smells:)

And, most importantly, they cut my hair correctly...all of the barbers and any of the barbers at V's do a good job...they cut my hair right...as right as my poor misshapen head will allow:)

That's important to me, because (as I might have mentioned before), I'm not a ""classically handsome"" man...I'm a little bit ""quirky looking""...and a decent haircut helps:)

I'm pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the Beautiful Carin from second guessing herself and the (possibly drunken) decision making that led her to select me as her husband (no one ever believes that she proposed to me...I can't believe it myself...but that was a great haircut that I was sporting that day! :-)

So I'm back at V's and I'm happy to swing by and get my ""ears lowered"" (a colloquialism that I suppose is lost in the mists of time) and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at V's:)

There were the Brothers C, Ryan and Daren, two exemplary soldiers of fortune whose fame/infamy had become a thing of legend. There was Dolores G, the champion and primary breadwinner of the ensemble.  There was Chris B, a beserker, tenor, and master crafstman. And finally there was Robert O, perhaps the most enigmatic and mysterious figure of the group he stood on the precipice of reality and greatness. Some would deem him a young Hemmingway, or a more talented Ryan Seacrest- at any rate his presence lent creedence and semblance to a group whose sole purpose was to butcher pop songs at the seediest bar they could find.
Their journey first took them down the long and winding paths of 16th st, to a charming but treachorous haven of filth that belonged to Phil, upon arrival it was evident their Karaoke treasures were not to be found here. Onward their travels took them to their final destination- Pat Murpheys house of sin/shame on 32nd st and Thomas.
The drinks flowed, the songs were sung, Hearts were broken microphones were dropped, and Cowboy was on the top of his game (a sagacious old fool whose coolness rivaled the marlboro man) spinning his cowboy hat in the parking lot like a whirling dervish. cowboy had a wisdom and charm that is unmatched. As the night dragged on and the songs became more desperate, I found my drunk to be wavering and my wallet to be in want of funds, i said my goodbyes and took my leave of the company and wandered into the night whence i'd came.",review,10,pv82zTlB5Txsu2Pusu__FA

Recently, the moved ""down the street"" to a new, updated offices.  I am writing this review because it seems that MANY, many people use Yelp to find...anything.  Dr. Kuhl and his staff make going to the doctor as pleasant an experience as it can be.  Not only is the Staff extremely courteous, professional and cordial, they are actually friendly and nice!  They remember patient names; spend the necessary time with a patient when necessary, even if it means someone else will have to wait.  Dr. Kuhl, naturally, is a Board Certified physician, which should be important to anyone choosing a physician.  He is thorough, explains anything and everything about which you have questions, and goes over every test result with you, one by one.  If Dr. Kuhl thinks you need to see a Specialist, he is the first one to make that recommendation.  There is no ""ego"" involved.  I think the most telling thing I can share with you is a memory of something that happened in his waiting room when I happened to be there - many years ago.  The waiting room was full.  He was running late.  Suddenly the door opened, and there stood Dr. Kuhl.  He APOLOGIZED for keeping everyone waiting, but said, ""I have a patient that simply needs more time than we had scheduled.  I promise each of you, if YOU were that patient, I would do the same for you.""  I think it is rare that a physician ever apologizes for keeping you waiting, even when they walk into the exam room.  This was extraordinary.  I would recommend any of the physicians in this practice without any hesitation.  Also - if you have an emergent situation, they find a way to see you - that day! That is a huge thing in my mind!",review,1,j4bxJyvIBwpL1KS-S65Mbg

I haven't had to wait long either visit, and when I did need to reschedule one of my appointments, it wasn't a problem either.

I had some routine lab work done today and Susan, one of the nurses there, couldn't have been friendlier.  She was professional as well and luckily, the blood draw went super smooth; I hate needles!  I had such a satisfactory experience that I made an appointment for my husband to go see one of the other doctors in the practice for a physical as well.

I love that they have authentic, non-Americanized carne options like buche (pig intestines), tripas (beef intestines), lengua (tongue- best I've ever had), and cabeza (beef head). And you know what, each and every one of those weirdo meats are effing delicious. Cooked to perfection. Fall apart tender. Melt in your mouth delicious. So freaking good.

If they can make beef intestines taste delicious, you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable. 

They make their own tortillas and both the flour and corn are tender and flavorful. You'll end up looking forward to that first and last tortilla-filled bite of a burrito, and you'll wish they doubled up their corn tortillas on the tacos. (And don't worry, you don't need a double banger tortilla on the taco. I've only had a corn tortilla disintegrate on me when I've left it to sit and sop up juices for ages.)

Make sure to take advantage of the salsa bar. Get lots and lots and lots of the aguacate sauce. That spicy green avocado sauce is the most amazing condiment. The red and green sauce will suffice in a pinch, but that bright green avocado sauce blows 'em away. The marinated carrots, cucumber slices and radishes are also spot on. Their strange pico with lots of cabbage is a concept I haven't seen anywhere else, but it's crazy complimentary. Give it a whirl.

The only issue I've ever had is with consistency. Sometimes a burrito will have rice and beans, other times it will be a meat-o-palooza. Not that big of a deal, and certainly nothing that will keep me away from the best quickie Mexican I've had in the valley.",review,5,tlSSQwfHYJany7wPoTH46A

Best burrito you will ever not-finish. I HEART CHIPOTLE and no matter what, I will never STOP going!

Today I went in alone because my children are grown.  It had been at least a year since I was there with my boys and the manager asked how they were doing.  She recognized me!  All those people she sees everyday, and she remembers me and my boys!  That says a bunch about her relationship skills.  

My middle son, Justin T. Webb, had passed away when a wreckless driver failed to yield before turning left and I shared that with her after she had asked about them.  She was touched and insisted on buying me my lunch.

I'm *trying* to be sort of careful about what I eat and making sure I get more veggies, blah blah blah.  So I got the mixed meat salad -- because I still needed some gyro meat.  All I can say is WOW.  The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the chicken was great -- marinated and really tender.  And, FINALLY, gyro meat that dreams are made of!  Perfectly seasoned, and just freakin good!  I chose the house dressing -- garlic, lemon, and olive oil -- and it was a great choice -- it was awesome.  This big ass salad comes with pita bread, but I'd get an extra, so you can sop up whatever dressing is left.

I am eternally grateful that I did. This little unassuming small shop might serve the best gyro I've ever had.... And believe me, I've had a ton of gyros. It's one of my favorite sandwiches. 

Since it was my first time here, I went with the beef gyro lunch combo. They also serve chicken. Nedda (sister to Elie) was sweet and included a side of her delicious made-from-scratch-daily hummus and pita quarters. All of the food was quickly prepared by Elie in the kitchen and it was served so fast I hadn't even had time to take two bites of the tasty salad Nedda have me as the side to my combo. It's incredible how such simple food can be elevated by super fresh ingredients and the deft hand of a cooking master. Both of these things are found at Elie's Deli and it shines in their food. 

You also know a restaurant is special when the owners know most customers (who walked in during the duration of my visit) and call them by name, inquire about families and work, tell jokes and laugh together. Elie came out from the kitchen and chatted with everyone in the dining room for a few minutes and brought people's lunches out from the back himself. That kind of personalization transforms a simple lunch into a community experience. 

And to be clear, the menu is much more extensive than Mediterranean food . You can dine-in or take-out. They have American style deli sandwiches and burgers too...some things I'll have to try the next time I come to Phoenix. Maybe. If I don't get the gyro again.",review,0,uDa5XWxHEpetG6Io2A1p-w

The wife enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan, which I can vouch for, is at least two meals and well worth it.  The small side salad is always fresh green-leaf lettuce, black olives and cucumber, with a side of creamy ranch dressing.

With the help of Slice, I've successfully trained my daughters to understand the difference between real pizza and those 30-minute delivery donks.

My favorite, and it is back on the menu, is the lobster tortilini.  It is not cheap but it is so friggin' worth it!  paired with a nice white wine or if you've got some more hair on yur b@!!s than I do, maybe something stronger.  They've got every brand and make of gasoline you could ever hope for.  When finished be sure to have some cream cheese brulee with an espresso martini.  Talk about a little jolt of a libation...this will get your eyes poppin' for sure...

T'Cooks is the top notch eating outlet in the Royal Palms Resort.  And if you have not already heard about the architecture and landscaping on the resorts 9 acres...be sure to take a little stroll.

I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture, gardens, water fountains, patio, and charming walk-ways and courtyard. The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming, reflective mood. I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms. 

I've read some of the reviews and I've always had great service here. I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner, but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table. My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone, but was mistaken, lol. Anyways, I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough. I've enjoyed the Asian pear salad, too which is flavorful and has great texture. But if you're looking for one appetizer to try, definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo. My mouth just started watering. It's not breaded calamari so it's healthier and also tastes better (5 stars).

As for the main course:

-Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave, sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars. I'm not much of a duck person, but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender.

-Wood roasted ""Pulet Rouge"" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake, asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars. Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor, which I appreciate. I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I'm not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure).

-I've tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time), nibbled on my date's plates and everything has been really good.

I want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I'm not dieting. The bar area is also super sexy, sleek and mysterious. They usually have a live piano player at night. I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it's like you're in another world besides the AZ desert.

In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul.

I had the calamari and shrimp first course, which was delicious.
She had the red onion and rosemary soup with havarti cheese, which was also delicious

We both went with the lobster toretllini which was really tasty and had lots of lobster but some the lobster pieces were a little bit chewy. The tortellini was delicious as was the lettuce that came with it. 

Desert was outstanding. We shared the chocolate fantasy - very very rich chocolate that when combined with the  vanila gelato and cherries was a great combination.
The caramel cheesecake creme brulee was also fantastic. It was much lighter than the chocolate fantasy, which was very dense.

When I got home and answered the query ""where did you go for drinks?"", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(

Because, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)

You know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!

T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say ""everything is good"" when you ask for their recommendations:)

Maybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)

I have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)

I was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)

We had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)

Onion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)

Carin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:) 

I know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)

I had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)

They also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)

We had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)

I tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)

Time really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)

But such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire ""do you love everything?"":)

It was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!

I headed into the bar to meet up with a few folks and the interior is just a beautiful space - warm and welcoming, and very classy. Bring people here that you want to impress.

I, of course, had to order a glass of champagne and the lovely server brought it right to me. Perhaps she sensed I had been delayed at the airport that day before arriving to Phoenix for 7 hours? Or more likely they are just very good at what they do here. We immediately ordered since it was so late and I started with a pear, pecan, and blue cheese salad. For my main course I choose a seared Irish salmon that was served with leeks, tomato gratin, and a pea puree. It was all fantastic, but the tomato gratin made me want to invite the chef to move to LA with me. I mean no way could I afford that now, but a girl can dream!

Now how great a job would that be . . . . and guys- no more wondering what to do to impress- just call up and they will take care of it all. 

Want rose petals scattered about your table? No problem. How about a poem reader? Got it. Or a private violinist? Again- they will make it happen. They will even put together a private dinner out in the garden for you. ""Ahh. Romance"", she says wistfully while thinking about her evening. 

But I digress . . .all this talk of romance has overshadowed why I always choose T Cooks for dinner every time I head to the Scottsdale area. It's the food, the bar, the service and of course the ambiance. 

Enter this historic Mediterranean villa and you know you are in for a special evening. To the right, the restaurant, to the left, the bar. And not just any bar. Live music is always playing and the bartenders (Jason and Jeremy) are terrific. You can eat at the bar (they have a separate bar menu) but my advice is to wait and eat in the main restaurant. 

Usually I ask to sit outdoors- either in the front courtyard around the trickling fountain, or in the back, Tuscan styled gardens. On this night- it was a little cool so we compromised and took a seat by the windows looking out. 

Warm, fresh bread is placed on the table with a garlicky pesto sauce. Try not to eat too much as you'll want room for their wide variety of appetizers and entrees. 

We went with the charcuterie plate, plenty of meats and cheeses to start. As for our entree's the sliced ribeye was the pick of the night. But there are plenty of choices from chops, to fish to lamb. 

Service was spot on (friendly, accommodating, and attentive) and we even got to meet the ""Director of Romance"", Robert, who made me wish I had known about this service before. Robert asked if we were staying in the hotel (we weren't) for if we were- he said he could work his magic on our room while we ate. It made me want to change hotels, if only for the night! 

Our evening ended back where it began at the bar listening to old Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra tunes being crooned out by an amazing duo, while sipping a tawny port and reflecting on the dinner we had just experienced. 

This is not a cheap date.  Dinner for two was around $200 but worth every penny.  Go ahead, splurge.  It's worth it.

For the entree I had a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by the Sommelier, to go with my New York Strip. I added a side of roasted brussel sprouts with duck confit which was outstanding!

I had Scottish Salmon that came with crispy onions, asparagus, and a cheese supreme lemon tomato tart. Everything was seasoned and prepared perfect. The tart was so unique and unusual, it looked like a slice of pizza and I was tempted to pick it up with my hands to eat. 

My dish was great but my husbands dish might be the dish T Cooks is most proud of, it was the Paella. Some of the ingredients that were in the Paella were cockles, calamari, pork belly, chicken, perfect prepared shrimp , sausage and mussels. Not only a delicious dish but also over generous in size to be enjoyed again.

The inside out ice-cream sandwich tasted almost like a gourmet milky way bar it had those flavors but it was made of chocolate sponge cake and frozen milk chocolate mousse.

I did not have a problem with them adding a 18% gratuity to our bill for two people since I usually tip 20% and added on the rest. I am not sure if they normally do this or only since I was using my preferred restaurant card that gives me one meal for free.

Saved over 250.00 per night as the room we booked was normally over 500.00 a night.  Loved this place, probably the best resort I've stayed at in Scottsdale so far.  Our room was a terrace suite over looking the pool and Camelback Mountain.  Had two terraces on each side of the room and the views were beautiful.  This time of the year all of the citrus trees were blooming so this fragrance of lemon/orange filled the air!

Thanksgiving in Arizona was a wonderful experience thanks to the feast we had here. We arrived at 11:15 and sat down for a 2.5 hour buffet enjoyed in their sunny side patio. This was my first time here and it's amazing to know that their renovations are fairly recent because you would never guess it! The Spanish style tile roofs, huge trees and beautiful overhanging Bouganvilla really set the tone for this place. It has so much character and thought put into the layout, you can't help but feel relaxed.

Thanksgiving Day brunch was wonderful! (If only you could take some home for leftovers!) Although I did miss doing some cooking of my own, I have to admit it was nice to skip out on grocery store madness and be pampered for a change! We finished 4-6 plates (the guys ate more!) from their cutting station: turkey, of course, pesto topped salmon, and prime rib, made to order omelettes, salads, and desserts. My only critique is 3 of us got a bowl of squash soup and it was so salty none of us could eat it. Must have been a fluke because the rest of the meal was delicious. They definitely have hired the best. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, gracious and made us feel right at home. And in case you missed their Thanksgiving buffet or you want a repeat performance of their awesome spread, you can go a month later for their Christmas smorgasbord. 

I would love to stay here next time. From what I learned, each of the rooms were decorated by a different interior designer so they are all unique.

The lovely presented me with a spa gift cert for three services. When I arranged the appointment, I asked if I could increase the massage time from 60 to 90 minutes in lieu of the second service and was told 'of course'. So I booked a 90 minute stone massage and a pedicure. 

The day of the appointment - my birthday - I was greeted with a 'happy birthday' and shown to the women's shower/changing/steam room. Its not fair to call it a locker room, its simply too lovely for that. There is a second 'relaxation room' where you can sip tea an enjoy small bites while you wait. Delightful.

As for the massage itself, may I just say that it was the most relaxing 90 minutes of my life?? It was one of those times where time goes by much more quickly than you want. I didn't want it to end. The room has a vaulted ceiling with what look to be the original beams. It has two tables and shower heads above each for the citrus scrubs [yikes did that sound sexy...] The woman [you can ask for gender preference if you like] who worked on me - Carol, I think - was great. I was kept warm the whole time either by her hands holding the smooth warm stones or by the perfect weight of the covers over the rest of me. I felt perfectly taken care of. My 5x operated shoulders have never felt so relaxed. I walked out of there and into the ahhhhmaaaazing not-locker room [stocked with everything - and I do mean everything - you might need, right down to qtips, shave cream and disposable razors] where an out of town guest asked me what I had done and she told me I looked stoned. All of that without drugs!! The showers, walk in and large enough for a family of 5, are similarly equipped with all of the spa products to use and enjoy. Lovely. 

As an aside, I don't mean to short-change the pedi but I am a girl who has frequent pedi's, so this was less of a treat than the massage which I'm less likely to get for myself. It was pleasant, in a nice atmosphere but nothing seriously out of the ordinary. And sorry my lovely, but not worth 80+ dollars. 

There are nooks outdoors - each with lounge chairs and fireplaces - where you can relax and unwind further. Or you can have lunch there with your book - which I did. Menu, lunch, it all comes to you quickly, sweetly, happily. Makes me wish I lived there. Its quiet and lovely and is a great match to the experience itself.

Am I wildly, madly in love with everything at the Royal Palms resort? Absolutely!!! Do I want you to go there?? NO! But only because I want this place completely to myself! Located off Camelback at the base of the beautiful Camelback mountain, this boutique resort is a little slice of heaven in the middle of Scottsdale. From the towering palm trees to the lush green foliage to the heady aroma of flowers everywhere you go, this place is an oasis of beauty and relaxation. 

My favorite time to go to the Royal Palms is at night, when the twinkle lights wink at you from hidden corners, and candle glow from the various secluded tables light your way from nook to nook. I recommend going around 8, when the live music starts. Listen to the bluesy singer's sultry, melancholy voice as you enjoy a glass of wine on the garden patio. Or perhaps take a romantic stroll across the grounds until you come across a secret garden tucked away, waiting for you to find it. 

The restaurant and bar are top notch, and have a great happy hour that lasts until 6pm Monday through Thursday. Or, if it's a hot summer day, take a little stay-cation and relax by the gorgeous pool in your own private cabana. 

The entire property is enchanting, and makes you feel like you've stepped into a place where time stands still, and the only thing to do is enjoy the tranquility that surrounds you. But like I said, you really shouldn't go there......",review,6,zqnAdayPsak5dbLF2gEvNw

From the moment we arrived we were greeted with authentic kindness and care. We were whisked from our car, straight to a simple check-in area [complete with delicious iced tea and lemonade] and given a tour of the grounds as we were shown to our room.  
 
All the rooms in this resort are 'casitas.' Basically, you get your own little house with a kitchen, sitting area, big bathroom and lovely bedroom with plenty of storage space and dressers for each person to have their clothes.  Turn down service happens nightly and the cleaning crew seems to sneak in and out of there anytime you are gone.

The pool is lovely, and again, the staff is welcoming and remember who you are after meeting you only once.  Also, they could gouge you on the prices there, but guess what THEY DONT.  [Especially in terms of resort standards]

We also had a couples' massage at the spa which was incredible. Before the massage you can hang in your separate locker rooms which have a eucalyptus steam room that leads to an outdoor jacuzzi and shower, as well as lounge chairs to chill in the sunshine before you have your service.  When our awesome massages were complete, we were handed champagne on the way out and instructed to take a quick steam and shower to help pull out the toxins brought up by our massage.  Again, the staff was incredible and caring and I love them!

One cool thing about this resort is that they provide an environment where you don't need to feel obligated to tip at every turn [except at the restaurants] by instilling a very reasonable daily resort fee [$28].  This included unlimited valet parking, which was worth it alone!

All of this and I never even mentioned how gorgeous the grounds are. Immaculately kept, thoughtfully designed landscaping surround these historical grounds, and the rooms are lovely as well.   This is also a fairly small resort, which is nice because you end up being a part of a nice, intimate community of vacationers.  And on our trip, it was 95% adults. We saw one child the whole time we were there.  [Not that I don't like children, but it's nice to have some peace on vacation :)

All in all I can't express how enamoured we both were by our stay here. We felt very special, were greeted with smiles and 'hellos' everywhere we went and treated like royalty.

My husband and I booked our stay for one night last Tuesday on the day of through the Hotel Tonight app. $100 for the room... truly a steal. There was an extra $30 resort fee tacked on that all guests must pay, and which pays gratuity for the valets and housekeepers, gives you access to the pool and fitness center, etc. The pool, by the way, is open 24 hours, which was so cool because we are such night owls and we totally had the pool all to ourselves at 1 in the morning. The pool also has floating rafts you can use for free, plus clean towels, comfy lounge chairs, cabanas, and bar service. The pool did not disappoint.

The customer service was phenomenal. The woman who checked us in was very chipper and seemed genuinely happy to have us there, and one of the valets gave us the tour of the resort and showed us to our room. He was very helpful and kind.

The room was decorated lovely, and although we had hoped for a king bed, we made do with the double beds we ended up with (apparently they were too booked to hook us up with a king bed). There is a large bathtub in the bathroom, but the wall next to it can be opened up completely, so it was like taking a bath in the bedroom. Really pretty and neat. Plus, they had candles set up, so you better believe your heiny I took advantage of those.

My only qualm is that housekeeping came knocking at our door at 11 (check out wasn't until noon), successfully waking us up as we had gone to sleep really late the night before. My husband had to run to the door before they came in, as we were both *ahem* in the nude.

We had the short rib flat bread for $7. Which is not what you are thinking when you hear the word flat bread. It's more like a tortilla in which you dish in the short rib meat (no bones) and lather it with this heavenly goat cheese. I could have eat that cheese all night. In addition, we had the pretzel bread bites that came with dipping cheese. The first few pretzels I dipped with the cheese but then I realized that I still had goat cheese left. Think of a bagel lathered with cream cheese. That's what I did with the goat cheese and pretzel bread. Our total tab came to $18 (included one soda) before tip.

I was lucky enough to have my wedding at the Royal Palms and must say that the experience from start to finish was spectacular. Set against the backdrop of Camelback Mountain, the setting is simply stunning. We had our wedding reception in the Estrella Room with the cocktail hour in the courtyard in front of the room. 

Before getting married here, I was told by anyone I spoke to that the wedding food is by far the best they've ever had anywhere else. I completely agree with this statement. The food is a culinary masterpiece. It doesn't taste like your typical catered food. It tastes like the food they serve in T Cooks, if not better! Everything you eat, down to the bread and pesto dip is extraordinary.  

The service is about as extraordinary as the food. I worked with Suzanne who was extremely helpful from start to finish. Each bride and groom gets a ""shadow"" for the wedding day. Our shadow was the fabulous Christy and followed us around while we took pictures and throughout the whole night and made sure we had cocktails, food and any other help throughout the night. She even helped me in the bathroom with my large wedding dress! I can't say enough about Christy and how helpful she was throughout the night. She was calm, comforting and helpful throughout the whole night. 

I will end this review by saying that ""you get what you pay for"" and while the Royal Palms is on the pricier end, it's worth every penny and they make sure they work for their money. Everyone is kind and helpful and I couldn't imagine getting married anywhere else.

Besides the wedding experience, I was also lucky enough to stay at the Royal Palms the night before and the night of the wedding. I highly recommend staying in the Valencia Casita #125. It's got an adorable courtyard, little sitting area, a small kitchen and a nicely sized bedroom. The rooms are intimate and have a lot of character.

I appreciated the guys always asking, ""Will you be needing your vehicle shortly or should we park it in the garage?"" Plus, they were always speedy about getting our car for us when we phoned them from our room. The front desk clerks were pleasant and there was always delicious complimentary Royal Palmer (aka Arnold Palmer + Grenadine) in the lobby.
After setting our things down in our room, we took a late night tour of the resort. Wow! Absolutely gorgeous resort! It's a decent sized resort yet has a small Mediterranean-style feel to it. Since we were hungry, we stopped by T.Cook's Lounge. There was live jazz music and the food was delicious. Be sure to order a Moscow mule.
The following morning, we went to the pool. All the pool servers were extremely attentive. As soon as we walked up to the chairs we wanted, they laid towels down for us and brought out large glasses of iced water. Talk about amazing service! The pool food was good, not great, but we didn't expect too much when it comes to poolside food. The pool area was very quiet and relaxing. Highlight of hanging at the pool? I got stung by a bee in the armpit as I was sunbathing on the pool float bed. Went from relaxed to freak out mode. Awesome! That would only happen to me. After much relaxing in the sun, we went for a hike on Camelback Mountain. Definitely a must. The scenery from up there is pretty cool.
That evening, I managed to break the on/off handle to the bathroom shower as I went to turn it off. And I tell ya, that water came rushing out and pinned me to the wall! As I screamed for help, my significant other yelled out from the loo to see what was going on. It was Dra-matic like only something that would happen in a movie!  Luckily, their maintenance guys responded very quickly and took care of the issue. Oops!
All-in-all, we had an amazing and relaxing time here. I'd highly recommend staying here while visiting the Phoenix area. You won't regret it.

Yes. That's the sexist truth. So after hearing a number that made me gasp from a Ford dealer I turned to a dude. He recommended Spitfire Automotive. Actually, who he recommended was ""Mike Carlton on Indian and near you.""

Can I tell you next to useless this bit of information is on Google? (Still shaking my head on that one.) Anyhoo, I finally found the owner. With such a glowing referral (the dude had used him to fix his off road racing bikes many, many times) I figured, ""Eh. Ok. Besides, what do I know?"" And it was conveniently close.

After speaking to Mike to confirm his hours of operation I dropped my car off. His team was able to look at my car the next day of operation. They confirmed the diagnosis the dealer made lickity split. I was shocked, there's no way to emphasize the level here, but SHOCKED when Mike called with his estimate. The difference was substantially less *and* my car was going to be ready the very next day.

Let me say that last part again:
My car was going to be ready THE NEXT DAY.

I don't know the location of the magical unicorn tree where Mike grows Ford dealer parts. But my car, Bear, is so very happy. No need for a rental car, so I was happy too! 

Spitfire Automotive is family owned and operated. It was opened in 1958 by Mike's grandfather when Indian School was a two-way dirt road. Currently the shop handles automobiles and motorbikes. There are plans to move motorbike repair to a northern Scottsdale location (74th St & Butherus Dr.) where it will be called ""Dirt Riders West"". Motorbikes can be purchased at Spitfire Automotive. While there I got my first up close and personal look at something called an off-road Beta Motorcycle 300.

The next part will make men groan. (Ok. Maybe some women too!) I'm looking at the bike and I think. ""Hmm. It's ...red."" I don't know! These are things that go thru my head. That, and, you better gosh darn write a review for this place. It's girl friendly. Manly place, but girl friendly.

Do you fight the extreme shopping crowds of Black Friday, or do you do something... anything... else. As I do every year, I went with the latter.  I booked an ATV tour with Stellar Adventures. 

Stellar stood out from the other ATV tour/rental companies because they seemed to be the only one I could find that would allow my 13 year old son to drive an ATV himself. 

We signed up for the Four Peaks Tour. The tour takes you through some of the desert trails of the Tonto National Forest. This was a first time experience for all of us. Chad, our guide, took his time to explain how to use the ATV's and made sure everyone was comfortable. 

He was very knowledgeable of the trails and the area as well. His experience enhanced the tour, since he was able to stop along the way to explain what the trail ahead had in store, while also pointing out mountain ranges, lakes, and other tid bits.

There were some slightly challenging areas along the trails, but everyone was encouraged to go at their own speed. No one was expected to do anything that made them uncomfortable. It was very clear that safety was a priority. 

This was an awesome time. I'd recommend it for locals or tourists. If you've never ridden an ATV, this is a great way to try them out. We will definitely be bringing out of town guests on this tour in the future, and may even buy our own ATV's, it was that much fun.",review,4,7e1XAK4j95x-ibEy4qFKYg

But this is where I started and since the beautiful Carin and I moved back to Old Town Scottsdale a few months ago, we switched back to the Camelback location as our primary club (we have a membership that lets us use any of the clubs and we worked out mostly at DC Ranch and Gainey Ranch when we lived in north Scottsdale).
The facilities are terrific and since they remodeled the Camelback location to bring it up to par with the others (and probably better than Gainey, although I do love the steam room at Gainey Village...sinks in the steam room, so that I can shave in the steam room...pretty sweet!).
I am not a class taker. I have done the yoga classes a few times, but nothing other than that. The beautiful Carin is a class taker and loves the classes and the instructors.
I am runner, cardiac and lifter kind of guy for the regular exercise and I play squash, all of the equipment is up to date and in good shape.
The Village also does a great job on events for members. They just had a casino night that was really very fun, and included in the membership fees. They do all sorts of things like that from golf outings to ski trips to hikes in the Grand Canyon...a little something for everyone.
Mostly, the people are why I give these clubs  (and esp. Camelback) 5 stars...we have met some of the nicest people at the club. Some of the guys that I play squash with have become family friends, as well as some of the people that work at each of the clubs.

25060,sR9lSQiTuBg8zsIw9Zd-Dg,4,2009-04-30,3,Bp0ZPJ5BFQq4QFDNV0M3Hw,5,"I love my gym!  Prior to joining I tried out all the gyms around my house (Biltmore area).  That includes the LA Fitness by Trader Joe's and the 24 Hour Fitness on Camelback.  Each one was way too crowded for my tastes and lacked in basic human necessities (e.g. LA Fitness does not provide towels!).  I also have a lifetime membership to Bally's that my parents bought me in the mid-1990s, but there is not a decent Bally's close to my house and the closest one is just not the type of place that inspires me to want to work out.  So for a year after moving to Phoenix I debated whether to fork over the dough for the Village.  How much dough?  Well, the pricing varies but it is about 5 times as much per month as I was quoted at LA Fitness and came with a fairly large startup fee.  So far, I have found that it is worth every penny.

What do I like about it?  First and foremost, I have never had to wait to use a machine, ever.  They have so many machines, and not nearly as many members as the other clubs in the area.  During my trial period at LA Fitness, I seriously waited 5-10 minutes each time I wanted to get on a cross trainer, and then there was a time limit.  A gym is a place to work out, not a place to stand around or worry about time limits.  Second, the Village is huge: two swimming pools, endless tennis courts, indoor basketball, indoor running track, cycle studio, indoor racquetball, indoor kids area with Wii fitness, massive weight room, large stretching room, pilates studio with all kinds of human torture looking machines, yoga studio, group exercise rooms, a bar with Kilt Lifter on tap, a snack bar, indoor and outdoor lounges, TVs in all the right spots, a spa and equipment shop (and probably much more that I am forgetting).  It's physical size also doesn't say anything about the size of their programs, which range from basketball leagues, swimming, hiking, ski trips, cycling, fencing lessons, etc.  There is always something happening and there are often social activities going on that I don't partake in, but which I hear are pretty fun.  Finally, in my very humble opinion, I think they have the best schedule of group fitness classes around, taught by the best instructors in town.  I take on average 4 yoga classes per week and every class is included in the dues.  If I were to take a similar number of classes at a local yoga studio, I would easily pay double my current gym dues and would not have access to all the other great amenities.  Just joining for the yoga would save most avid yoga enthusiasts money in the long run.

As for my complaints, they are minimal.  My biggest complaint is not about the gym, but about my friends;  I wish that more of them were members!  Most of my friends seem to be LA Fitness people and just balk at the idea of paying more than $30/month for a gym.  That's just plain silly, but I understand that money is tight these days.  My only other complaint is that the classes tend to cater to an early crowd.  I will never make it to a 6:00 a.m. yoga class (who can seriously drag themselves to the gym that early?).  Like most late risers, I would prefer later classes instead.  The latest classes in the day seem to be around 6 pm, which is usually fine for me since I am self-employed, but there are days that I wish the last yoga class was at 7:30 so I would not have to brave the rush hour crowd trying to make it there.  

Overall though, I'm very happy and would recommend anyone give the Village a try.  Oh, and if any of you yelpers are seriously thinking of joining and want some good karma, let me know because I can get a free month by referring you :)",review,7,5JSrHtH-aK69OjUxdt-k5A

When I turned 30, someone gave me a lifetime membership to Bally's as a gift so I started going because, well, it was a gift and already paid for.  I started seeing some really hot bodies on women in their forties and I started to change my mind.  

But I was not faithful to Bally's because I just didn't like the atmosphere of the place.

Once I started to appreciate the value of a work out, I started gym shopping.  Tried LA Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness, Lifetime Fitness and none of them kept my attention or loyalty.

Finally, I ventured into the Village Racquet & Health Club- mainly, again, because friends would have me either workout or play tennis with them at the Camelback Village.  This is where I've fallen in love.

I love the facility, the classes, the equipment, and I don't know who I love more- the people who work there or the members.

There's some kind of magic to the Village clubs- aptly named the Village because somehow, the place, the staff, the members becomes . . . your friends!  The Village clubs truly is a lifestyle, not a place where you go to sweat off a few pounds then leave for someplace better.

I've worked out in all three locations at one time or another.  Each location I've discovered has its own flavor- Camelback for tennis, classes held early in the morning and in the evening for the working professional, the BAR- Gainey for the triathletes, classes held early in the morning and in the evening, again for the working professional- and DC Ranch for families with a great pool area and classes scheduled more for the stay at home moms.

I love them all- I love going into the beautiful facility, getting greeted by a warm smile from the staff, seeing gorgeous people who are committed to living a healthy lifestyle.  I love how clean the locker rooms always are and there are towels and water just where you need them.  I love the abundance of classes- spin, yoga, pilates and the ever addicting zumba.

Like most have already said on here, the  prices are more than other gyms in the area; but The Village is also so much more than other gyms in the area. I paid $500 to sign up and then pay around $140/month for my membership. Yes, this is a lot of money, but for me it is definitely worth it! I had signed up to the other gyms in the area at different times for $25-30/month, but I think I only went 2 times in the two years I was paying the memberships, so it was cheaper but not worth the price. I go to The  Village sometimes 6 days per week and will even go when I'm not working out just to sit and do stuff on my laptop (they offer free Wi-Fi) or to get lunch or dinner at one of the two little cafes. 

The Village is what you make it; what you want it to be. You can go and just do weights and cardio in the extensive weight room and cardio room. They have tons of free weights and machines and then even more cardio equipment. Even during the busiest times at the gym I've never seen machines filled like I have seen at other places.  There is a 1/18 mile track upstairs with another workout room that has a variety of equipment including a TRX and Kinesis. 

If you want to go above and beyond just working out by yourself there are many different classes which range from Zumba to Yoga to Spin to Athletic  Conditioning and more. 

The Cycling room has, I think, 45 bikes which are completely adaptable to you and very comfortable for spin classes. The Yoga room is beautiful, calming, relaxing and not out in the open like many other gyms. There is a Pilates room which is fully equipped with reformers and tons of other Pilates stuff. There is also a basketball court, squash court, raquetball courts, 15 tennis courts and 2 pools, both heated one for play and one for laps. 

They have a full spa and salon, a wine bar that serves food, cafe that serves food and smoothies. The locker rooms are fully equipped...you don't have to bring anything except the clothes you plan on wearing home! I don't have kids, but they also have locker rooms for families and rooms for kids while parents are working out. 

Like I said, The Village is what you make it. This is true with the different activities that they offer. There are hikes, running groups, weight loss competitions and non-exercise related activities, like Casino Night.

Even with limited parking and sometimes long lines, I cannot take a star away from LGO.  I love the atmosphere, I love the food, I love the iced tea (both black and green), I love the coffee, I love the gifts, I love that I can bring the dog, I love that I can sit inside or outside, ok... you get the point.

Since my first visit to LGO when I was fresh off the plane and got lost trying to find the location on the corner of 40th St. and Campbell, I've been addicted!  It's got character!  It's not in a strip mall!  It's in a great neighborhood and I partially chose where I currently reside based on the fact that I can walk there...

Whether I go for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just a cup of coffee or a cookie in the afternoon, I love the European feel to this favorite of mine.  The music is unique and it's just a great energy... not to mention the people watching can be quite entertaining.

My favorite menu items are the fruit/granola/yogurt; the birchermuesli (similar to a cold sweet oatmeal and oh so delicious); the daybreaker omelette (great if you're watching carbs); the commuter sandwich (for breakfast or lunch); the chopped turkey salad, the nicoise salad, the vegetarian and stacked turkey sandwiches... yikes, I pretty much like everything on the menu.

Sushi samplers are ok and pizzas (served after 4:00 I believe) are really tasty.  You can also sit down and have waiter service at the LGO Pizzeria which is connected to the grocery side and open in the evenings only.

I'm not sure if I wrote anything different than the 32 reviews that came before this one, but I needed to put in my 2 cents on this neighborhood favorite.  

Oh - actually I just realized that no one has commented on the LGO apparel and other cute gift items... the shirts are so soft and fit so well that I have 1 and my BF has 3 (no joking).  We love them.  I swear I don't own stock nor have any relation to the owners, but bottom line is I HEART LGO!",review,5,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw

It was a Saturday morning and I was driving on fumes and had to stop for gas. While sitting there, a stranger approached me with an ""Excuse me, can you tell me where I might find a decent breakfast place?"" I looked at him and said ""Welcome to Phoenix, today is your lucky day and you're in the perfect spot.""  We are on the corner of all corners - and it's Saturday - which means abundant options! So, I go through my favorite three options: Vincent's Farmer's Market, LGO and Over Easy.

I gave him a brief description of each and when it came time to give my rant about LGO, it went a little something like this....

""La Grande Orange! Oh my gosh, you'll never see anything like it...Look for all the cars and the full staff of parking attendants. Look for the line going out the door. Even more fun, go through the back door and say hi to the kitchen staff (very Durant-ish).  Have the French Pancakes, The Commuter Sandwich, a croissant, or an English Muffin. Go look for great cheeses, fig spread, or affordable, small production wine options, buy your next birthday card or something you don't need there. Look at all the cute families, dogs and have a double cappuccino.""

He looked at me realizing that I've probably already had one too many double-capps that day and as I said goodbye, and we both pulled out of the gas station, I couldn't help but wonder which of the options he and his family would choose.

It took me a while to get up to try this quaint little gem out, but it was well worth the wait. I went up on Sunday afternoon (12/1/08) for brunch with my friend Jamie. Both of us we pleasantly surprised on the nice little location on the corner and little picnic style table outside. 

First we walked around and looked at all the specialty items that were scattered around the store. Being a wine enthusiast, I got to see some interesting wines sitting in their beautiful wine racks. 

For how busy it was in there, it only took us 2 minutes to order, because of their employees to help guide you though. Both of us ordered delicious egg sandwiches on english muffins. Having choices of different topping I went with avocado, sausage, tomato, and cheese. With Jamie doing the similar, but with bacon. (There was a jealously generous amount of it too!) 

While we waited for the sandwiches, we got coffees from their espresso bar, and walked around the shop some more. After grabbing the sandwiches and taking them outside to share a picnic table with some strangers, we devoured our orders and sipped out coffees.

If you love Whole Foods then you'll love this mini-version. It's a cafe, coffee shop, pastry shop, and grocer that sells anything from fresh greens and post cards to hot sauces and wine.

Gabi K brought me here for a small pre-flight brunch. We walked directly up to the counter and ordered from the menu. Like what I saw: lots of health-conscious entrees. Everything looked so delish, especially those breakfast plates they were flinging across the counter with egg whites so artfully laid out alongside fresh fruit and multi-grain toast. 

After placing our order, we snagged a very small table near the bottled wine. There I spot various jams; particularly the mimosa jam caught my eye, made with oranges and Champagne. I bought that for a future birthday brunch we're planning at the lake, along with some peanut butter dog treats for my little schmoopie. 

When our food finally came out, just minutes later, my seared ahi tuna sandwich (new to the menu) with avocado, greens and tangy sauce was soon just an empty plate with a few bread crumbs and a watermelon slice. It was a large serving stuffed with so many fresh goods, but even more delectable I devoured it before I could even ask Miss Gabi how she was enjoying her Commuter breakfast taco.

I was told to go to this place by none other than Gabi M., because I am a philistine and I had no idea it existed.  But I didn't go right away.  Which was my loss, because this place is phenomenal.  I finally ended up here somewhat fortuitously because a student of mine suggested it.  Anyway...

I've been doing this phoenix biggest loser thing because my wife says I'm the biggest loser in phoenix, so when Amber W. started up a competition with the same name I figured hell, I can win that.  Turns out it's about weight loss and so that pretty much means I'm screwed on the $25 entry fee.

Well I wasn't until I went here.  My diet was doing very well, thank you, *until* I went to LGO.  As soon as I walked in I was met with a tsunami of poor health choices and didn't know just how to hold it together.  Pumpkin-chocolate chunk muffin? Blackberry bran muffin? (Which I ordered because bran=fiber=healthy, der!) Strawberry muffin? Cream cheese coffee cake?!?! and a million more delightful delicacies which tempted me for forty seconds before I gave in.

Well not really.  Here's how it went down: I held firm and got oatmeal with bananas, strawberries, and raisins.  Spare me the nutritionist's take, I'm confident that was the best I could do.  So I was pretty proud of myself.  But I *did* have to bring home a muffin to my wife because that story about her saying I was a big loser was a lie and she's actually pretty great.  So I paid for the strawberry muffin but at the last minute changed to blackberry bran at an employee's recommendation and GOD DAMN i am glad i did because that is probably the best muffin I ever had.

Note: Since the charming Gabi M. decided to laugh at me for my food choices *all night* at the OYE I will point out that I ate only 3/7 of the muffin.  That's it!  that's like, um, a 57% healthy choice based on my math.

Anyway my student had an english muffin with avocado and smoked salmon that I was looking lustily at so she told me that I *must* have an english muffin.  She bought a pack and gave me two (I'm a good tutor evidently) and so of COURSE I HAD to eat one.  I say that defensively because Gabi laughed at me for the english muffin too.  I'm scarred.

Anyway.... I know this review is dragging because my wife is now watching Lifetime which means that her head is being filled with all sort of anti-man propaganda as I type.  So I'll wrap it up: 

Today we went there and I had a croque madame which is a whole grain open face deal with ham and tomato and mustard and a sunny side up egg.  Pretty damn good.  But we also had the strawberry muffin which was a little disappointing: not moist enough and not strawberry-y enough.  So I give this place five stars anyway because it is super cute and I don't think I could eat everything I wanted to eat there if I went in for 14 days straight.  I loved it.

And for the acting on Lifetime, one star.  And the writing:

Eating here reminds me of eating at some little cafe on state street in Santa Barbara. It's quiet and quaint and has a very local down to earth vibe. Sure, the parking is a bit tight, but there is plenty of parking in the surrounding neighborhood and we didn't mind walking for a few minutes from our car on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. 

The breakfast menu is reasonable and the food is worth every penny and then some. We tried the french pancakes (crepes) with fresh fruit and the croque madame and the Venice beach burrito. All were exceptional and left us wanting more. Before we had finished our meal, we were planning our next trip to La Grand Orange. 

The grocery store inside is cute and has fun trinkets and specialty sauces and food that a lot of people were buying. Although it was bustling with business, there was plenty of seating outside in the garden area, which was perfect on such a beautiful afternoon. 

And one final note....if/when you do visit this place, you MUST MUST MUST try their famous home made english muffins! Ohhhh, they are good!

Next, the caveat: I LOVE it in the mornings, and as it gets more crowded into later AM I move toward liking it less, to the point where, depending on season, I truly dislike it when it is overrun with tourists and other mouth breathers.

When it is at it's best (early morning to mid-morning weekdays, and early mornings weekends), it's got a great, urbane energy, is filled with attractive, interesting people, the food comes out fairly quickly, and it is the ONLY slice of NorCal energy I have found in the metro Phoenix area.

My faves include the double cappuccino (BEST in town!), french pancakes (with everything!), Croque Madame (GOTTA do the ham), the scones (very unusual variety), the Daybreaker (if I'm feeling like being healthy), any and all chased with a bottle of San Pellegrino water from the cold case. The fresh squeezed OJ is good but VERY pulpy. OH - and the new 'side', mac 'n cheese (w/jalepeno), is AMAZING. OMG SO creamy and delicious. If you have only ONE thing, seriously, this has to be it!

A warning......when they are not over busy the place is awesome, and you don't have to hover by the counter waiting for your cap or food to come out, and it's good, and hot. However, when the place is swarming, idiotic people who don't check the ticket for their name (food comes out and your name is called, but then it sits waiting), will walk off with your stuff, and/or the quality is just not as good at the these super-busy times, so I would encourage you to come when it's not slammed, or go elsewhere if it is.",review,2,hm6KwsSUEE5wyKLr6ZDyaA

The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.

Walking in, it was really crowded and there were tons of cute little knick-knacks for sale, so I couldn't really figure out how it was a restaurant... that was until I saw the counter and the giant menu of items they offer! After some deliberation I went with the reuben (always my top choice) and a glass of iced tea. I was needing a pick-me-up meal, and this seriously got the job done. The reuben was huge and was piled high with juicy corned beef and a layer of delicious cole slaw, and was on some of the softest marble bread I've ever had. I was amazed! As if the glorious sandwich creation wasn't enough, it came with some sweet pickles and a big slice of pineapple. I couldn't believe how perfect this lunch was! It had me full and back to life in no time. And don't even get me started on the iced tea.

One other awesome detail... they play great music! Get your Shazam app ready, 'cause you're going to want to know the titles/artist names of every song that comes through the speakers.

My ex picked a condo near 36th and Camelback 6 years ago.  Then I lived in a funky, cool condo community near Campbell and 44th.  And now I reside within a minute walk of La Grande Orange Grocery (pronounce it LGO, much easier) and the original Postino Wine Cafe.

Cons:
-Parking lot is silly small for how popular (and amazing) this place is. Although, this well NEVER deter me from going here. Even if its just to grab a quick coffee.

Ok.. now that I really sit and think about it, that is the only Con to this delightful establishment. Walking through the shop you can find the most darling and useful items including: funny/witty random items, coffee mugs, to go cups for iced drinks (a MUST in AZ), t-shirts, books, art, calendars, magazines, etc... You can also purchase cold beverages outside of the restaurant or coffee bar and they also have a huge selection of wine for a small store. I purchased a darling La Grande Orange to-go coffee mug and if an art piece my boyfriend loves is still there when I arrive next friday.. I will be getting that for him.

The coffee bar smells amazing and even though I have only had one  iced toddy (AZ friends, i'm catching on ;))  from them, I am in love. The barista was super knowledgable and friendly and guess what ? She managed to not screw up something as simply as an iced beverage. I also purchased a bag of their Organic Ethiopian coffee. It is sitting in the apartment in AZ just waiting for me to come back! They bake all sorts of delicious treats daily and they have a food menu outside of the restaurant. They offer lots of quick fast goodies to take on the go as well as breakfast options for all of us loungey-coffee/brunch/patio-with-our-laptops people. ME. 

While I was there I dined in the restaurant and our experience was great. We ordered cocktails while we waited for our table and they were fresh and delicious! So nice to have a real drink outside of UT. We were seated quickly and our server was very helpful, friendly but also very laid back which I love. We ordered the  grilled artichoke which was of course amazing, a vegetable pizza and another round of drinks. As we finished up our dinner we walked around the shop one more time to take in all the amazing random stuff they sell all while a great AZ storm was starting to brew outside.

Beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, café, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is La Grande Orange Grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to ""fit.""

Harbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go I made my way into La Grande Orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing I could think of when I entered the door was a trip to Whole Foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  With cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once I entered and started to browse I detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.  

Having already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at Bianco for later in the day I took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  With many items baked in house and others provided by Tammie Coe Bakery two doors down I weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable I ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as ""the best thing in the world;"" a promise I told her I'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab I made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as I checked into my hotel.)

Beginning first with my selection, La Grande Orange's very own Red Velvet Cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better Red Velvets I've had in some time save for the stellar version at Bouchon Bakery just one month prior.  Loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what I'm pretty sure was clove I really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.

Moving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the Tammie Coe Crumb Bun, I really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what I received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet I had on my visit to Arizona.  Beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous Breton Kouign Amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  Layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all I can say is that if you find yourself in the Phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections I was lucky to be staying so far from La Grande Orange and Tammie Coe because otherwise I'd have gone back for more.",review,2,5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA

That doesn't mean I'll share them with you, because I won't. 

However, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, mainly about how I do little or nothing for my fellow man and how the karma from that might bite me in the ass someday.
So i'm going to share one secret with you about a Phoenix restaurant this one time. 
LGO.
The food is superb, the service is quick, the ambiance, fantastic. That's not the secret.

The secret is MJ's breads. 
MJ Coe is an award winning baker whose breads are the best in all of Phoenix.
All us natives know this, and now you do too. 
LGO not only uses his breads in their  sandwiches, they offer them by the loaf. 
And here's the secret that hopefully keeps me out of the karma-cancer hot seat. 

MJ offers a signature chocolate-cherry french bread that's quite simply the best bread on earth.
The color of chocolate, dark brown, it looks like no loaf of french bread you've ever seen, almost like a pumpernickel.
Outside, the crust is perfect.
Inside, the crumb is moist and chewy, with large chunks of what I can only presume is world class chocolate along with whole fresh cherries. 

And as if the chocolate french bread wasn't enough, biting into a chunk of chocolate or a cherry in every bite is the experience of a lifetime, one you won't soon forget.
But plan ahead.
LGO doesn't shelf this bread, it's a special order requiring a one day notice. 

Here's another tip, mainly for men. 
Order at least two loaves. 
One for the drive home, as you incessantly pick at it until its DOA. The other to present to your wife in a blatant attempt to barter something other than jewelry for a blow-job.",review,1,iwUN95LIaEr75TZE_JC6bg

I'm a terrible person.

The first time I knew I had a problem involved overnight guests. Somehow they assumed I'd be churning out pancakes and percolating coffee early in the morning. HECK NO. I pushed my friends down the stairs (pfft! to their protests) and off we went. Once they had coffee in their hands and were ready to contemplate making a breakfast order, things were good. 

Sure, I could have turned on the Martha Stewart charm. But why bother? I have LGO in my neck of the woods. Anyhoo, here's a tip, which is going to kill me to share. There's no need to wait in that monster line in the middle of the store to place a food order. It's true. You can place a food order at *any* cash register. 

I just died a little. Everyone that knew that secret now hates me. (So yes! Head on over to the coffee area and place your food order.)

Whelp! An update as I've been prompted. Yes, there are two distinct sides to this operation. The ""Grocery"" (right side) where you queue up for breakfast and lunch. The ""Pizzeria"" (left side) where there is everything else. But I don't see a distinct separation. So my review below is of my top faves. Yes, you have to order the items below on the left side. But you can eat them any where you'd like! When you order breakfast/lunch you usually end up meandering over to the left anyhoo, so there ya' go!

FOOD
I'm already a notoriously long writer. So I'm just cherry picking two favorite food items. The roasted chicken and the smoked salmon salad.

Por quoi?
Well, I had never eaten a roasted chicken quite like the the one prepared at LGO. My supermarket special, which I thought the high heavens of, opening the bag and sighing as I absorbed the heavenly, delightful, smell? That was nothing. LGO's version is an experience. The chicken sighs as it falls off the bone, the skin greeting me with a light crispiness.  If I could recommend anything to pair with this, it would be the caprese salad.

Wait? Did I say salad? I found Phoenix's best salad *ever*. The smoked salmon salad was so delightful my dining companion can't wait to order it his next visit. A manly man. Imagine that. A salad that a guy is gung ho on ;) All kidding aside, this salad was filling, fresh and offered a diversity of textures. All while being healthy. Sometimes salads can be...too rich. There was no ""to go"" box. I ate every crumb to my leggings capacity. 

DESSERTS
I stop in here often for cupcakes and their miniature versions when I have a need to impress. Yes, I cheat that way. (Don't tell my Mom!) A box of their artistic works not only look delightful, they taste delicious. Their chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are ginormous. (And dangerous!)

DESIGN STYLE
The first time I visited I was awestruck by the novelty of the store in restaurant concept. (I'll update my review to show Instagram photos from here.) It's just the coolest place filled with the neatest things. If you need a gift to to buy, I'm sure you can find it here. They stock books, cards, t-shirts, mugs, candles, purses, you name it. I bet their buyer has thought of it. (They even have a special section for children's gifts.) 

WINE/BEER 
On the Grocery side (right side) of the store where the shopping is there is wine and beer you can buy. Had I not been with a regular I would have missed the obvious. Buy your beverage, meander to your table, drink it. (No fee!) Glassware is in the middle of the restaurant.

PARKING & MISC
So yes, this restaurant is popular. Parking can be tight. (But there's now additional parking on 40th & Meadowbrook.) They are bike friendly too! If you have called an order in, don't fret. They have short term parking. Noted clearly with signs and diagonals on the pavement.

LGO (as I learned it's called in PHX) is just about one of the cutest spots I've ever been on my various trips to Phoenix. Coming from Seattle I'm very familiar with businesses that focus heavily on locally sourced goods, fresh locally grown produce, and a strong general focus on being eco friendly while not losing their edge or charm. LGO is like a breath of the Pacific Northwest for me!

It's a local business that's your one stop before you head home. Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here. 

Racks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!

There's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family. Nothing you buy here is going to waste!

This Target is in a convenient location, not too far from the hotel where I was staying/working.

While this is slightly frustrating as a wine (whine?) snob, i have to give it up to Postino for making available the varietals that people like me want to drink when they're spending $11 a glass at a wine bar.

I'll always pretty much have a soft spot for this place, as it was the site of some magical shit between me and my gf (Iknow, I'm romantic) on our first ever date.  So, if you ever need an idea for a first date, or a 50th date, this is your spot.

Not sure why it took me so long to write my own review, maybe because the 67 that came before mine do a pretty good job of describing it.  However, I woke up today and felt like giving my two cents - so here goes:

Whether you go to Postino for a business lunch, an afternoon glass of wine, a happy hour, dinner, or even after dinner drink - you can't go wrong!  Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  

I've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!

I'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!

Can't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!  Postino has a regular loyal customer in me and I don't see that changing anytime soon!",review,10,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw

While there isn't a HUGE menu to select from, the bruschetta, soups, salads and paninis are perfectly portioned, amazingly tasty and refreshing, no matter what time of year. Their unique selection of bruschetta includes apple and brie with fig spread, proscuitto with figs and mascarpone and salami with pesto (plus a few others). And their wine list makes up for it. They have an extensive selection that they change out regularly, and you can buy a bottle on your way out to enjoy at home.  My favorite that I discovered at Postinos is the Hey Mambo.

Tucked away in a charming neighborhood in Phoenix, Postinos is a great place to enjoy some wine and bruschetta. They usually do have the garage door open, so you get the fresh outdoors no matter where you sit. When the weather is perfect out, the outdoor seating is great too.

Skip the paninis, and opt straight for the bruschetta.
Do not hesitate to order the ""proscuitto with mascarpone and figs""
What I love about the menu is that one can order up to 4 selections of the bruschetta for $12.75.  This is a very filling choice, but with groups of four you can extend up to 8.
I cannot do these delectable eats any justice if I don't give them a name.
Recommendations below are my tops, my do or dies:

fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil
smoked salmon
prosciutto with figs and mascarpone
brie and apples with fig spread

the flavors are bold and fresh, even the flavor combinations seem daring on some.

soups and salads are available here, as well as paninis.I am not a fan of paninis, but the prosciutto with brie was very well done.

Best night to come:
Tuesday after 8p  ($20 tuesday, where you can enjoy a bottle of wine and bruschetta for only $20)

Happy Hour:
Not exactly, but wines by the glass are $5, seven days a week, from 11-5

It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.  I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.  

We had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.  It was good, but I always have red peppers and goat cheese, and since I have a ROARING sweet-tooth, my #1 fave was the ricotta, dates, and pistachios.  Tied for 2nd place were the mascarpone and salmon.  I'm not much of a prosciutto fan, as I find it a tad too salty, but the sweet mascarpone cut through some of the saltiness.  The salmon and capers were so tasty!  

Nice atmosphere- lots of positive energy.  Our server was efficient, friendly, and never overbearing.  Cute restroom.  My only complaint is that it is so dark indoors!  I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again- I like to feast my eyes on the food's presentation!

I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. 

All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as ""Cinnamon Toast Crunch"", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. 

To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it.

The location and ambiance are perfect. The interior is decorated very tastefully and the selection of wine is proudly displayed. The patio is wonderful and relaxing. 

I was there for lunch and ordered the half panini (prosciutto and brie) with a salad (raspberry chicken). The panini was stuffed full of fresh ingredients and perfectly crunchy. The salad was crispy, with delicious chicken and sweet/tart raspberry dressing. 

The service was impeccable, while all along being super friendly. This seems to be a hard thing to find these days. 

And on a sidenote...what makes Postino special is not their extravagant extensive menu, but the simplicity and thought that goes into every single ingredient.

Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber! 

The parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her. 

Our server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. 

For the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. 

Unfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect.

I can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready? And you say that I can do this on Monday and AGAIN on Tuesday, starting at 8pm? Every week? Can this be true?  Thank you, Postino, for having the best wine and food deal in the valley, and creating a great atmosphere in which to enjoy wine with friends. 

I love wine. So do lots of other people that show up at 8pm sharp, rain or shine, to take advantage of the awesome Monday/Tuesday special. So be prepared to wait for a seat. If you are sharp like a hawk or stealthy like a fox, you might catch one of those coveted bar seats, but otherwise you'll stand at small tables, casually drinking your wine and doing some people watching until the host finds you and guides you to your table. You will love your wine selection. Your bruschetta will be made with the the freshest ingredients on crusty MJ bread, in the perfect proportions. Do try my favorites: Prosciutto, mascarpone, & fig; Red peppers & goat cheese; Ricotta with pistachio & dates; and Pesto with smoked salmon. Happiness served on a wood-cutting board. I paired my bruschetta with a spicy corn chowder, and it was just the best meal for a rainy night. 

The servers are very cool and know what they are talking about. They will not steer you wrong with a wine selection. If you order a bottle that is not to your liking, no problem! They serve all wine by the glass, so you can easily send it back and try another! They want you to enjoy your experience and selection, and thus have built in the flexibility for people to take risks and try new wines. Have fun with it! 

My suggestion is to find a friend or two, valet the car, put your name in for a table, get started on a bottle, make laughter and conversation, and finally take your seats, enjoy your food, and order more wine. You will be fully satisfied and will have had a great night. Do recommend it to your other friends, and definitely make plans to return again soon.",review,3,Vdi-fbSA36s6jffY7iDbXA

Went to Postino with co-workers for lunch today. It's the perfect place for a Friday lunch, especially when the weather is nice. We sat inside but they had the ""wall"" open so it's was kinda indoor/outdoor which added to the nice atmosphere of the place.

They had $5 drinks so we all indulged (it was Friday after all). I had a mimosa that was made with freshly squeezed orange juice. Very tasty.
For lunch I ordered a half prosciutto and brie sandwich and half mixed greens salad. Both were delicious.
The sandwich came on ciabatta bread that was nice and fresh. It included several slices of prosciutto, a nice thick slice of brie, arugula and fig spread. At it was served toasted. The fig gave a nice sweet compliment to the salty prosciutto and the brie gave it a nice warm gooeyness.
The salad was mixed greens with grapes, pear, and candied walnuts with a light vinaigrette dressing. I love fruity salads and this one did not disappoint. Everything was very fresh and the dressing was flavorful.

They also offer a good variety of bruschetta so it would make a great place for happy hour if you just wanted a drink and a little bite to snack on.

I love getting him to try new things and even more so when he actually likes them. The smoked salmon with pesto and warm artichoke pieces were also delish. The nine iron was also very tasty.

-Bellini: so fresh and tasty and only 5 bucks!
-Pinot Noir: can go so wrong, but was so right, especially for 5 bucks!
-Pitcher of beer: a yummy, citrusy wheat beer; about 2 and a half glasses to these pitchers, but again, only 5 bucks!
-Pub Board: yummy, warm, salted pretzel bites, excellent cheese, chorizo, and corn nuts. Great with beer.
-Bruschetta: OMG so good!  One order gets you four large bruschettas (cut in half for sharing). We loved the goat cheese with roasted red peppers, brie and apple with fig spread (swoon!), white bean with tomatoes, and salami with pesto. Oh so yummy.

Speaking of the main course, I had a panini type sandwhich with chicken, tomato and mozzarella that I really enjoyed.

Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. 

Every time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. 

Their food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?",review,6,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

 Favorite slab consists of: Roasted Red Peppers on Goat Cheese, Warm Artichoke, Dates, Pistachios with Ricotta and Sheeps Milk below a sweet Tomato Jam. 

 The only *bad* (more so just personally annoying), thing I've ever come across here, had nothing to do with the food itself or even the servers..well not our server..was when one of the ladies walking around clearing tables felt the need to express to us that SHE has OCD therefore, we needed to remove the last 2 pieces of bruchetta from the board, so she could clear it..because it was making HER uncomfortable..

 Never push your 'disorder' off onto someone else and expect them to abide, especially when your customers are deep in mid-conversation about serious things like puppies and the night's baking agenda...this customer will not yield and out of spite, leave a lingering, lonesome bruchetta upon the slab for your sake.

 I, too, have a disorder - not caring about your fear of individual bread pieces on a plate.

Consistantly high quality, great service and even better atmosphere.  I am obviously not alone in this thinking because Postino can have a hefty wait time, especially for the bruchetta and wine special on Monday nights.  Its WORTH THE WAIT though.  The goat cheese and tomato jam bruchetta is the BEST!  I always try to get a double order of that one instead of picking four different kinds.  I do believe 'sharing is caring' but I have my limits and not when it comes to Postino brushettas.  

The wine list is extensive and there are always helpful recommendations for any palatte or budget for that matter.  I have sat at the bar and sampled various wines before choosing and the bartenders have all been very knowledgeable and friendly.  

Postino is a perfect place for a date, girls night out, or family dinner.  It is hard to find a singular place that is so appropriate for any occasion.

You get any bottle of wine and a plate of the most decadent bruschetta, for $20. We're not talkin' a few little slices of bread with some chopped romas and basil... We're talking about full-flavored, substantially protein'd, tasty-ass bruschetta here, folks. You get to choose 4 of the 12 varieties they offer, and you get 4 slices of each. That way you and whoever you go with, can try them all. TWO PIECES OF EACH FOR ME AND TWO OF EACH FOR YOU, NO CHEATING. I'm watching you. And counting. And nomming.

The prosciutto w/ figs and marscapone
Smoked salmon w/ pesto
Brie & apples w/ fig spread
Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese

That is what I half expected about Postinos.  Instead, this place EXCEEDED the already high expectations others had set in place for it. 

I came here on a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago after a wine tasting at LGO. It was 6:30-7:00pm and we only waited a couple of minutes for a table. 

It was just me and a girlfriend and since we have the same taste in wine, we decided to order a bottle to share.  We had the RIckshaw Pinot Noir which was delightful.  For food we had the Cheeseboard and the mozzarella and tomato jr.  AMAZING.  I love cheese (as do most wine lovers) and their cheeseboard was delicious.  It features a great variety of cheeses from mild to strong in flavor.  

In my eyes the best combo of foods and flavors is the ever simplistic tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.  Postinos does it perfecto. Everything is fresh as fresh as can be, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

I had major food envy when I saw the table next to us get served an impressive plate of Bruschetta.  I will definitely be trying that the next time I come. 

Here is how much I loved this place: I just found out my schedule is changing and I'll be getting off work at 3 instead of 5.  Literally the first thought that popped in my head was ""I can make it to Postino's for their amazing happy hour!""

If you love wine and bruschetta than this will be your own version of Heaven. Blasphemy? Then you've never been to Postino! Seriously, they have the best bruschetta you're likely to ever have in your entire life. My top four: 

1) Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
2) Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
3) Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese
4) Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes

Also worthy of mention are the amazing sandwiches. I highly recommend the Autostrada (Sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish) and the Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise). Fucking awesome.

As you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20. But be warned, it'll be jam packed. Keep in mind they have two other locations as well. For you east valley residents there is a new Gilbert loction. If you are in downtown Phoenix or west valley, then the Central Avenue location a couple blocks north of Camelback will be more convenient.

So, lets face it, you're not scrolling through 578 reviews to find mine, and really, i'm not terribly offended by it. Let me do you (and me) a favor and break it down very simply and give you the hard.cold.facts:

The best day to go: Monday night

Why?: $20 for any bottle of wine and a bruschetta board (4 different types) starting 8pm

Strategy: go there 10-20mins before and scout out for a table. Expect an extremely long wait if you get there after 8pm

What to order (in order of tasty): [Bruschetta] Tomato jam and goat cheese, fig and prosciutto, Apple and brie, pesto and salami, pistachio and date, caprese (lacks balsamic vinegar and olive oil). [Other] Olives.

Don't bother getting: white bean hummus is pretty insipid and the artichoke dip doesn't add much to your meal, nor is on discount during their Monday specials.

Best group number: 2-4 is pretty perfect. Anything more will be hard to accommodate as the space is pretty small.

Overall impression: ridiculously good deal on Monday to share with 4-5 people, paying only $8-10 to get sufficiently tipsy and full. Location is classy, service is pretty decent but be aware that the parking situation sucks as the lot in front of it will tow you for parking there.",review,2,GRgBu4K7GOb3354esp_xkg

~Fud/Drink~
I have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.

~Atmosphere/Service~
The Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.

~Extras/Rating~

Regarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here. 

 No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water. The only thing I hate about this place, is that I didn't think of it first.. :) 5 stars because they deserve it, enough said.",review,1,joEN2Mx6n2FNzsIrR0CpjQ

Postino gets the privilege of being my first review! I have been in the Phoenix area for a total of 7 days since January and I have ended up at various Postino locations 4 times in those days. That says a lot from somebody who normally would always try a new place instead of frequenting the same spot over and over. Here's why:

Fun vibe - casually bougie without the pretense (it's possible!). 
Awesome servers - attentive and personable without being annoying or overbearing.
Amazing bruschetta - perfectly toasted with great combinations of toppings. I prefer the savory over sweet. 
Excellent wine and beer selections - they've got your standards plus the locals plus some unique options that'll keep you busy.
Price is right - I'll gladly share my student loans + interest with Postino, even after 5pm as I did last night with a group of friends.

I will say the cheap Asian in me isn't a fan of the valet parking (it's not always there, though). They are lucky I'm too lazy to walk in the heat of summer. My mother would be so disappointed if she knew I paid for valet.  

As a new transplant just down the road, I have a feeling I'll be back many times.  For those of us busy during the day, I am so happy they have weekend happy hour and date night specials. Just need to find the date first, but I won't digress... ;p

We typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a ""must come back"" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!

Food~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  

However if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  

Bruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  

Paninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! 

Service~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.

All in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there.",review,11,YLE6GoJ61fb0QBF7JTkaJg

Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!

We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.

The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie ""The Bird Cage"" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!

Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice. This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so.

We had dinner here last night. When we first walked in, the decor and the plastic chairs were a bit off-putting, given the menu isn't exactly full of budget meals. But we quickly got over that when the Capirinhias arrived. 

The food: 
Potage de Frijoles Negros- hands down the best black bean soup i've ever had. I could easily eat just this for days. 

Pollo Cubano- The chicken and onions are very citrusy, and the meat is tender. You really have to like onions to fully appreciate this dish. Three stars.

Gallina Frita- Fantastic. The shredded chicken was full of flavor, and the onions and spices complemented each other perfectly. The rice and beans that come with this dish are different (Moros) than the standard, and they are wonderful. The dish also comes with plantains, which are good, if you like plantains. Five stars.

Chicharrones de Pollo- I wasn't a big fan of this one. It's fried chicken, but it had a very odd flavor from the citrusy marinade. I guess I am too ingrained in my ways regarding fried chicken because this just didn't do it for me. Another strange thing about this dish is the chicken itself- rather than having a leg or a thigh, the fried chicken pieces were the meat pieces used for making chicken wings. Two stars.

Bistecs Cubanos (Encevollado style) - I don't like beef. This steak, however, is probably the one beef dish I could eat with abandon. The meat is pounded thin and smothered with onions. Five stars, because I hate beef, and I loved this. 

Pudin de Pan con Helado- I tend to shy away from bread pudding because of the usually disgusting consistency. We ordered this on a recommendation from the server, though, and it was fantastic. Chocolate bread pudding with chocolate chips....yum. Top it with ice cream and you've made a great thing even better. Four stars.

I came here with a friend, and we used a Groupon.  I have heard a lot of great things from coworkers and friends about this small little place in Arcadia Phoenix area.  I have driven by it several times, and it was finally time to get a feel of Cuba.

The waiter gave us a very homey and family type feeling with the passion he showed by explaining the menu.  I ordered the Pollo Cubano, which has grilled chicken with savory sweet onions on top and a side of black beans and rice.  The onions gave a dynamic sweetness and yumminess that I can't explain with words.  My friend ordered dried plantains.  The first order had black beans inside, and the other was almost like a sweet plantain banana dessert.  We enjoyed the food family style with some beer.

I will definitely have to make a return trip to Havana Cafe!",review,2,AkJFqLqHHAKY3H5R8p7cPQ

Irma was helping us. When I pulled her over to inquire why she was going to cry, it was because a patron couldn't possibly eat his postre. (A general word for dessert.) Irma, our amazing server, laughed when I said I'd take his dessert. This is very laid back, chill place serving authentic food in an unassuming place.

I miss hearing my parents and family banter in their Colombian selves. Cubans apparently mix and mingle in a similar fashion. Irma wove her magic throughout the restaurant, smiling and laughing. Quite possibly the happiest woman in Phoenix. (Eventually a delicious red sangria was selected, which went down entirely too fast.)

But back to the menu. The menu is clear to understand to anyone, from any corner of the world. Yes, I had a head start as many of the dishes share palates with Colombia. However, the menu here is clearly translated into English for anyone to decipher. No need to fret. And if you're overwhelmed by choices, there are two things that might help you order. Forks designate ""Havana Signature Items"". Additionally you can opt for a Combination or Sampler plate. It's for the ""I Just Don't Know"" moments.

SEATING
I came here the night someone had their wedding reception! So yes, Havana Cafe readily can accommodate groups. With charm, sincerity and the utmost attention they can provide wonderful service to a party of two. We arrived separately on a Tuesday night around 6-ish pm. Patrons started to trickle in more so around 7pm. 

Upon arriving I learned there wasn't really a bar area to wait for my friend to arrive. No matter, I was promptly seated even though my party had not fully arrived.

FOOD
Eager to eat we ordered fried plantains. When offered an option as to how they were prepared, I jumped and asked for Tostones. The pounded green ones (vs. the sweet kind.) Salty, but not too salty, served with a side of mojo-garlic lime sauce. My mom and aunt prepare them slightly crispier, but these were still delicious.

For a meal the Ropa Vieja was divine. Humongous, but delicious. Shredded beef brisket, bell peppers, onions, tomato wine sauce and black beans over rice. I was surprised by the difference in texture of the onions on the rice vs. the brisket. It was nice to have a sweet, fresh onion on the rice. The brisket had a blended texture of spices with the vegetables. (Enough left overs for two more meals. But I'm a girl eating 3 ounces of protein in a meal.)

The night was young, and ma ' belly was full. The flan looked tempting. I'll have to send a recon mission back just for that!

And yes, the leftovers were excellent :)",review,8,gzJpPaHN-NXBkAZcZri3hw

At JT's Bar & Grill!

I can't say I'm a regular here, but this is definitely my dive.  The place reminds me of home back in Iowa.  Low, dark, and dink with some crazy-#$% flares hanging around, and I'm not talking about the stuff on the walls - wink!  I've been here enough and it's weird to say I've never really ate here until I saw it was 2012 Best of Phoenix Bar Food! Shawa!?  Sweet and awesome article so my friends I gotta try.  

I ordered their wings after watching how the cook made them.  Fried tossed in sauce and then grilled.  Never saw it done like so, but I'm not a fan of soggy wings.  I always order on the side, but the bartender convinced me to go with ""the works"", and keep it as is.  I'm not a sucker for pretty bartenders, but how can I say no.....ooooh shucks sure!  I did not regret the decision - no foo, not the ""Lebron Decision"", I'm talking about the wings!  Okay let's stay focused.  The wings came with a perfect texture of crispiness with a jolt of sweet and spicy sauce.  Bam!  Best damn sauced wings I had!  Thanks for the recommendation!  I ordered a side of fries to keep that spicy to balance the spice.  

Along with your food you must order a few drinks here.  Not the largest selection in town, but if you need that go to the Yard House ya hippy!  My AA (Affordable Alcohol) group would love it here.  In my opinion the drinks are pretty cheap considered the prices of most places these days.  

Overall, great bar to lay low if that's how you feel for the night.  It's right in the heart of the Arcadia neighborhood and it's not as rough as it looks from the outside.  I'm from Iowa and I've seen some rough bars and this place looks the spot, but once you start meeting the people around having a drink.

Not only is he the bees knees he was hands on. I was, quite frankly, surprised by that. But more on that in a minute!

To frame my experience, I popped in on a Tuesday night during the dinner rush. One of our friends had hopped on over ASAP to nab a table. (Apparently this place is hopping. She was spot on!)

It's a really cute place that is friendly to all sorts of different folks. 

If you want to watch the game? Sure! TV at the bar. 
Feel like eating at the bar? Yep!
Casual dining? Absolutely.
Dinner date (where you want to impress)? YES. 

I was (not on a date) but did see a number of couples engaged in serious conversation over wine. It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation. 

For dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.

1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness!
2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window. 

That being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.

Right. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something ""regular"" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!

Ok, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E. Hemingway beard in FL.

A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.  The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.  Delicious nonetheless.  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.) and it added to the soup quite nicely.  Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?  There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!  The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were ""Hungry Man"" sized.

Some side notes:

1.  Parking is awful for lunch.  If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.

2.  I ordered a water with lemon.  I received a water with no lemon.  When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.  I couldn't come up with one.  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.  Period.

3.  We walked in and staff #1 seated us.  Staff #2 took our order.  Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.  Staff #4 brought our meal.  Staff #5 cleared our plates.  Staff #6 brought our check.  Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?  I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of ""who will show up next and what is their task?""  It was still a little ridiculous.

4.  Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.  No shortage there.  It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  A big up for Taylor's.

5.  For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.

I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet.

You won't find the cynical abortion-pushers like Planned Parenthood at the Crisis Pregnancy Centers.  Instead of people who will hide information about your child's development and pressure you to make a quick decision for an abortion, Crisis Pregnancy Staff will provide you with as much information as possible for you to make a decision about the future of you and your child.

she said it would be ready by 5 and that i could pick it up same day. my hero.

She's 14  1/2 years old which (according to Dr. Bracken) equates to roughly 100 years old in human terms!

It's fairly rare for chowchows to live that long, although I have been extraordinarily fortunate to have both my chows live to a very ripe old age (Sam, my big chow made it to 16  1/2...I still miss him! :-)

I frankly credit most of that good fortune to Dr. Bracken and the wonderful people at Arcadia Animal Clinic...I have had many pets over the years and used many vet's in Portland and San Francisco...they were all good, all came highly recommended by trusted friends, co-workers and the like...but none of them measure up to Arcadia Animal Clinic!

We were looking for a vet after we had been in Arizona for few months and started asking around...more than  1/2 the people we asked mentioned Dr. Bracken as the best they'd met and highly recommended AAC...The beautiful Carin and I looked at each other and said ""this can't be a coincidence...6 people that don't even know each other recommend this place...let's go see him!"" 

And we did:)

Chow's aren't noted for either their patience or their warm and inviting demeanor...they are a little bit aloof and intimidating...I like that in a dog...both Sam and Dee are coal black, and with their black fur, black tongues, black eyes and gleaming white teeth and fangs, when they smile at you, it can look a little sinister:-)

But they aren't...they are teddy bears and Dr. Bracken and the staff at AAC took the time to understand that (they approach each pet as an individual and get to really know that animal:)

That was apparent at the first meeting of my dogs and Dr. Bracken, when he got down on the floor with them and they talked and played and became great friends (my dogs always love going to AAC...they love Dr. Bracken:)

All that personal rapport with my pup's is and has been critical...not necessarily when they are just in for a checkup or a shots update...but when DeeDee tore her ACL trying to chase a bunny or when she had a minor stroke last year...or when Sammy was finally just too tired to go on and they helped him over with respect and dignity...sorry...I can't see though the tears right now...

When I adopted Owen from the Maricopa County Animal Control Shelter, I was given a sample of food, some coupons, a disposable cardboard carrying case and a list of vets who participated in their program, in which your new family member could get a free check up. 

Once we got home, I eenie-meenie-miney-moed my way through the list of ""free first office visit"" vets, and made an appointment. A couple days later, Owen and I were at a vet appointment that made me feel like I had taken my car in for an oil change, and the vet was trying to sell me all kinds of new parts. Thus began my quest for friendly referrals, which led me to Dr. Bracken. 

I am a vibe person. I can read people immediately, and I am usually pretty right on. I took to Dr. Bracken immediately, as did Owen. Dr Bracken might be the cat whisperer, and from what I understand, he's just as great with other animals. He bonded with Owen, and even though you might have to wait a couple minutes to be seen,  you can rest assured knowing that Dr. Bracken will give your animal (or in some people's case, ""child"") the same undivided attention.

So fast. They change oil like Usain Bolt runs laps. Thats fast. I am trying to set a record for usage of the word ""fast"" in a Yelp review. I might have already hit it, which would be super fast. But not as fast as Avis. It took them about 20 minutes to do my change, which included topping off of fluids, lube, filter change, and a general inspection.

He is a major supporter of the local Master Gardener program, which is committed to educating the community on native plants of the sonoran desert or plants that will do well in this climate without being excessively needed.

The plants at this nursery are all either locally grown (which means that they won't immediately shrink back in to the earth when you replant them at home) or are grown in a climate that is similar. For anyone that has invested in plants, this is HUGE. Sure I love looking at the beauties at Home Depot, but unless you know what you are getting, they just wont make it in our oven of a climate here in the valley of the sun.

The staff is friendly and super knowledgable. If you have an idea of something that you would like (i.e.: I want something that flowers yellow from June through the frost season and will survive Southern exposure), they can lead you to the perfect plant. If you want some unique yard art, they have it. If you need to know why your bogenvilla has little black spots on the leaves, take a sample in and they will educate you on how to make it better. If you want something that they don't carry, ask and they will get it for you. I could go on and on with examples of incredible customer service. This place is simply the nirvana of gardening in Phoenix.

Another incredible service they offer is their website. They have a calender which is frequently updated. It will tell you everything from when to feed your citrus trees to the proper way to prune your rose bushes. The FAQ section will tell you how to get the white stuff off your clay pots, has a plethora of xeriscape resources for those of you looking to be more water conscious, and will help you with controlling pests in your garden. It's a great resource, and since it's local, the answers actually make sense for those of us that live here. Best of all... it's all FREE!!!

worked it  with, his wife,  six daughters

chose to peddle, plants, instead

the monsoon blows, a branch comes down

like Baker did, four decades,  long
we've bought from Baker, twenty years
and watched, the 'old way', disappear
in a town, where progress rules
scrape, then stucco, buyers drooled
at grabbing, their piece, of the dream

The Green Curry has a great flavor, but lacks the array of vegetables that set a few other places apart.

One season lasted all year and was the season of dropping leaves, seed pods and branches all over my driveway and yard, all day long.  The second season had all the same as above, with the added benefit of three months a year dropping sticky flowers and sap all over everything within 50 feet of it. Damn tree was so skinny it didn't even provide that much shade.  This tree taunted me with it's sap-dripping, leaf-littering ugliness. Over the years I grew to hate this tree. Something had to be done.  Something permanent.  I came up with a plan....

I plotted to kill this tree.  Yes, I was out to exact revenge.  I scoured the local craigslist for arborist hit men.  I met a couple in a back alley bar, had a late-night conversation with another....$600 dollars to off my nightmare in the yard, and a couple hundred extra to remove the body and bury the remains.  I couldn't afford this, I'm a cheap old man.  I looked some more...

For far less than the $800, I bought a nice chainsaw, cut the tree down and turned it into a big pile of firewood in my back yard.  I will truly enjoy burning each and every one of those logs.  But now what - I've got a giant ugly stump in my front yard, where I should have a new driveway!

So, I went to a big box place that rents things you can use to destroy stuff and hide evidence.  The clerk rolls out this flimsy little thing that looked hardly bigger than a vacuum cleaner.  ""THAT's what you call a Stump Grinder"", I said, looking at him incredulously.   I was sure I would break this toy if I touched it -""No, I said,  this is a real tree, I need a real tool, something I can hook up to my truck and drag to the scene!""  ""We doan got nuttin' like dat, man.  You should go to A to Z for shit like dat."" the clerk says to me...

Fortunately, A to Z is right around the corner from the scene of the crime.  I rolled in and found exactly what I needed - a Dosko 620H.  A fourteen inch cutting wheel with nasty sharp chipping teeth embedded in it.  This, my friends, is a stump-grinder.  After a quick, albeit unnecessary tutorial, the shop guy hooked this beast up to my truck and I dragged it back to the scene of the crime and began the task of destroying what remained of this ugly wooden beast that had taunted me for so many years.  Two hours later, stump ground down to below grade, and I even took on a second stump because it was so much fun.

Renting from A to Z was a painless process, I told them what I needed, they hooked me up with the right tool that was clearly well taken care of, it started right up every time, the teeth were sharp and the shop tech hooked it up and gave me a quick tutorial on using it.  Returning it was just as easy, I just pulled in, a tech came out and unhitched the beast, checked it over and gave me a pass.  I closed out my rental ticket and went home to enjoy the view, sans ugly tree stump.

The second thing you need to know is that Don Jose was the greatest Mexican Food restaurant on God's green earth. Oh, you could quibble with me about our definitions--what constitutes true Mexican food, etc, etc. Don Jose was, by most standards, a dive--a simple, no-frills, insanely inexpensive dining experience in a 60-year old former IHOP. The style of Mexican food they served was what we rare Arizona natives call ""Sonoran"", but what some others call ""gringo""--cheese crisps instead of ""quesidillas"", hard-shell tacos and tostadas, etc, etc. There were no sprouts or carrots or squid or catfish or organic cage-free okra on the menu; the burritos contained shredded beef or beans, lots of cheese, and they had a side menu of American favorites--burgers, grilled cheese, fries, the works. The interior was decorated on a $10 budget circa 1964 and it stayed that way until they closed the joint; the red rotary phone still hangs behind the huge 1940s cash register. 

It didn't matter what you ordered. It was all staggeringly good. There was no single item on the menu more than $4. The salsa was a mind-altering trip to an altered dimension where everything was made of delicious. The week they closed, they had lines around the block and wait times pushing three hours. I ate 36 cheese tacos in the space of 12 days. And 12 cheese crisps. And 8 burritos. And 20 bowls of chips. I'm still on the treadmill working it off, my arteries may never recover and I don't care. When they closed I felt like somebody in my family had died. Sadly, the owner decided to retire to spend more time with his family. What am I, chopped liver? I ate there for 25 years! I AM family, dammit!

I swiped a menu. Sometimes, late at night, I clutch it to my chest and sob. Maybe I can find a therapist who serves cheese tacos.

I snuck out of work and went straight there.  There it was! My furious cruiser staring right at me!  The sales person came up to me and asked how he could help.  I immediately responded with I want this one..... Sadly I was informed that it was a children's bike.  Now you understand how little I know about bikes.  He kindly escorted me to the adult section were I discovered a baby blue cruiser that made my heart melt.  It was dressed in a giant red bow and had white flowers painted on it, a tan leather seat with more flowers and cork handle bars.  The best part was that it had a basket.  I bought it right then and there.  The sales guy ( I wish I could remember his name) was so kind.  He took my new purchase to the back were he examined her and made sure she was good to go.  Before I left he made sure to tell me to bring it back in 30 days and they will give her a tune up!  Since buying her she has been back for a tune up and checked out perfectly.

1) I regularly wear clothes
2) I regularly drink red wine (almost as regularly as I wear clothes)
3) Clothes + red wine + effects of said red wine = This is why I can't have nice things.

However, Park Avenue is actually in the process of allowing me to defy human logic and somehow cross item #3 off of the list of ""General Truths about Georgeann's Life"" because I swear to god they can clean ANYTHING out of ANYTHING.  And for $2.25!  Just be warned, for some of the tougher stains (which I have many) you will get it back with one of those little signs that says they couldn't get the stain out without damaging the fabric. A lot of my garments come back with this tag, but like I said, I can't have nice things. However, most of the time I see the tag but for the life of me can't find the stain so I don't really care. However, if the piece was expensive or important to me, or if the stain is really noticeable and I am really sad about it, you can always ask them to give it special care and they will blow your mind.

Two examples: I had a brand new Kensie dress that I absolutely LOVED and brought to Vegas with me almost immediately after buying. Like most of us on our way to vegas, it got completely smashed and was a wrinkled mess when I pulled it out of my suitcase. Like an idiot, I tried to steam iron this rayon dress, despite the facts that rayon does not take well to moisture and I do not know how to iron. What resulted was water stains all over this brand spanking new dress, and me having to improvise an entire Vegas ensemble.  When I brought it in to Park Ave I asked them to please try and remove the stains WITHOUT removing the tags, thinking I might be able to get away with returning it if they really couldn't get the stains out. They got every one of them out, and I'm presuming by hand because I'm pretty sure putting it through the dry clean process would have melted the tags right off. I was SO impressed and asked what I owed for the stain removal. Clearly it could not be the same $2.25 I pay for washable blouses just because they come out all nice and pressed and I don't know how to iron. But it was! I insisted I should pay more, and they insisted that I shouldn't. 

Most recently I, ingeniously, decided to wear a white maxi skirt on the fourth of July. You know, that day where everyone gets extremely inebriated in the name of Personal Freedom? Also, that day it was forecasted to rain the whole time? Yes, mud plus a white, floor-length skirt sounded like a good idea to me (this is why I can't have nice things). Of course, like most us on the Fourth of July, the bottom got absolutely trashed and I was not surprised to see the dreaded ""Sorry We Tried :("" tag hanging when I went to pick it up. I took the plastic off right in the dry cleaners to somberly assess the damage and the girl behind the counter asked if I wanted to send it through again and see what they can do. Why, yes! Thank you for asking! On the second try the skirt came back completely pristine! Again at no extra charge.

Where do I begin?  How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.

We shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.

After that we shared 2 entrees:

The Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.

Here's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.  

We shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.

Along the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti ""I Sodi"", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana ""Colle Del Re"" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.

Service was outstanding throughout the evening.  All in all I would place Marcellino Ristorante on the short list of Phoenix's finest restaurants.",review,18,P2kVk4cIWyK4e4h14RhK-Q

The food was fantastic - as was the experience.  We'd been hearing about Marcellino Ristorante for awhile but it wasn't until we were looking for a place to celebrate Mother's Day that we thought to check it out.

From the moment I called to make a reservation, we received the friendliest service ever!  I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)

We were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!

Jared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.

All of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.  Note - no alcohol.

The Marcellino's people have done a wonderful job of creating an entirely different attidtude on this side of Stetson Drive.  Still very cool, very ambient, very laid back and not at all pretentious, but still different experience.

The thick cranberry colored drapesgive an old world quality to the mostly urban brickwork comprising most of the walls.  lit mostly by chandeliers and candlelight, the interior is warm, intimate and easy. No garish paintings or stereo typical florentine towers to be seen.  Well, there was a small reproduction of Rome's "" Mouth of Truth"" bolted to the wall next to the entry that kept staring down at me.  I liked it.  It brought back happy memories of Rome.

We would be experiencing the Tasting menu ($75 with 3 courses and 3 pairings)  Our server, Scott, made sure we had no food allergies or road blocks towards anything in particular.  A small cheese, olive and salami plate arrived first, compliments of the Chef.  Scott then proceeded to send over dish after dish of amazing Italian classics , like the large, single handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach bathed in an almost invisible butter sauce.  There was also some unexpected delights like the polenta strips topped with a chunky portobello reduction and the perfectly portioned filet mignon.  Each was delightfully different and kept our pallettes busy with incredible flavors and textures.

Wine pairings were also carefully selected and added that supreme finish to each plate. The tasting menu with pairings are always different, so you can simply come in sit down and relax and be taken care of. No regretful commitments to be made.

After four courses, with 3 wine pairings we were quite content to fold up our napkins and call it quits, but there was still more!  Scott finished us off with a beautiful Tiramisu accompanied with freshly whipped cream that was ablaze and courted with artfully sliced strawberries.  The Tiramisu was light, airy and delicately creamy.

My boyfriend & I went here on Saturday night and not only had an amazing dinner but another overall amazing experience!

Before dinner, we sat up at the bar where we had a few glasses of wine. Our bartender, Lou, took the time to get to know my name and made sure that my glass of wine was always full. It is evident that he truly cares about his customers and his restaurant.

For dinner, we started with the Imported Buffalo Mozzarella & Prosciutto appetizer. It was a generous portion and was wonderful. The ingredients are always fresh and it was the perfect way to start off our meal. (I'd say this is perfect for two people to share, unless you are really hungry!)

My boyfriend had the Santa Lucia for his main entree. It was delicious- And yes, he was generous enough to share. It is a ""Black cuttle fish ink infused fettuccine sautéed with muscles, clams and calamari in a lightly spiced tomato sauce and topped with half of a 1 1/2 pound fresh Maine lobster."" (I took this off their website because I decided my description could not do it justice.) It was an absolutely incredible dish- One not to be missed!

My dish was fairly similar to the Santa Lucia but not as big. Unfortunately the name is escaping me at the moment but it is a spicy tomato sauce with shrimp, fresh fish and calamari. It is phenomenal and worth every carb ;)

Our servers were both Rob & Johnny. They provided outstanding guest service! Oh and since it was a Saturday night, there was live entertainment. Some might consider the entertainer to be a ""cheesy lounge singer"" but I thought he was really good and put some romance (and laughs) in to our evening...

And for us, the revelation of why this meal was sooo good, went back to the source; fresh ingredients. And how do we know that Tutti Santi cooks with fresh ingredients, like fresh picked basil from their own garden? Because Nina, the 80 year ""young"" owner shared that, and a few other secrets with us, at our table.  

It might have been the comment that the gnocchi was absolutely as good as my wife's....... and THAT COMMENT was made in front of my wife! The word must've gone from our lips, to the server, to the kitchen......... to Nina herself! Because from then on, it was more than just a great Italian dinner experience. It was a great Italian dinner experience with ""Nina."" She left the kitchen, and came to our table, sharing some cooking, and life, experiences, and also sharing how she comes into the restaurant as early as 4am, just to make their fresh pastas..... and that great gnocchi. I couldn't believe her energy and spunk! Waiter........ I'm having whatever Nina's having for breakfast!!!

And yes, we started by ordering their ""famous gnocchi appetizer."" You've got to order the gnocchi; either the appetizer or the entree! Enough said on that. We then followed with one of the specials; Penne pasta with chicken and Italian sausage in a pink sauce. It was DELICIOUS... and I could taste the very traditional Italian sausage, which was perfectly seasoned. And the chicken? It was white meat strips that had an incredibly fresh taste, and wonderful texture. Our other dish was their eggplant parm. And just how good was that? My wife commented that it melted in her mouth; the best version of eggplant parm she's ever had. And it came with a very generous serving of spaghetti pomadoro. The pomodoro is a basic red sauce, and in this case, a very ""Roma tomato"" fresh tasting sauce. And because I asked about their meat sauces, the waiter brought me a soup bowl filled with the Bolognese sauce, which I liberally put on both their garlic bread and some of my penne pasta. That could've been a meal in itself. 

Nina's kitchens prove the adage that, ""...there's no substitute for quality and freshness!""

Tutti Santi and Nina could actually force me to revisit that attitude, it was that good.  We arrived for a dinner party with my wife's company.  I reviewed the menu beforehand and I was fully expecting a buffet of standards, prepared for the group setting.  Wrong.  We ordered off the menu and I couldn't have been happier!

Walking in, we were directed to a room off the bar, and being the last guests to arrive, they had already started on appetizers.  There were various plates of Fried Calamari rings with a Mariniera sauce, Caprese and Ravioli's in different stages of being consumed.  This was accompanied by plentiful baskets of delicious toasted Garlic Bread.  All of this was quite tasty, especially the Ravioli di Nina, tender, fresh spinach-filled raviolis sautéed in a creamy/cheesy sauce and served with a dollop of mariniera on top. 

The service was impeccable, as our heavily-accented server offered up wine, and took our orders.  He was attentive but not obtrusive, allowing the party to proceed at our own pace.  I had the house Chianti, an assertive red wine that paired well with my choice of lasagna di Balogna al Forno, an amazingly tasty lasagna of fresh pasta, cheeses and ground sirloin.  This was not your stacked cake of layered stuff, it was a creamy, savory, cheesy, buttery deliciousness that I would go back for any day.  My wife had a house special of Chicken sautéed with Marsala and Burgundy wine, artichoke hearts and Porcini mushrooms.  This too was a savory dish that combined the flavors of all the ingredients into a sublime experience of taste.

We finished with Spumoni Ice Cream, shared between us.  I don't know if they make it fresh, but it too, was creamy and hinted of pistachio and marischino cherry.

Nina herself came to our table several times to joke and laugh, she is an awesome and gracious hostess.  As we walked back to our car, we decided that yes, indeed, we have found an Italian restuarant that we will be returning to.",review,4,J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ

I had a client meeting there this morning (I know, I spare no expense!), and my clients were just as charmed as I was with Rainbow...the great coffee, the terrific donuts and fritters and the pleasant service (not to mention free wi-fi for my meeting) all combine to make Rainbow Donuts a significant step above the rest.

I took the pizza home and cracked open the box.  The mushrooms were thick, and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand.  The sauce was rich, and the crust was perfect.

After buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts, we finally tried Spinato's (after living in Phoenix since 2003). Yes, I fully realize how ridiculous it is that I hadn't been here sooner. 

There are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service, food, deals (coupon and daily deals), and conveniences (order ahead while waiting for a table). From the time we sat down (both visits), the service was top-notch and friendly. 

First visit, we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes ($15 for a medium). It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball. That was so good too! Oh did I forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter. Both, simply amazing. Clearly I was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline. I also had a glass of wine since they are half off on Sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go. 

For the second visit (a week later), we dialed it back a bit. Of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread, kids ravioli ($5 for the ravioli, a breadstick, drink, and scoop of gelato), small specialty pizza ($10 and plenty for my husband and son to share) and I had the ""lil"" spinach calzone (7"" for $5). That calzone was so delicious, I couldn't save the half I set aside for lunch. Add two glasses of wine (half off), and two piccola brownie desserts, and our total bill was $45. For a family of four with drinks, an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two).

I fell in love with some old school classic tortoise shell frames by Kio Yamato and modern black angular frames by prodesign denmark, so I got both!  I couldn't stop myself. 

My search for new glasses has a back-story.  About 5 months ago, my puppy ate my glasses.  I was upset, but not too upset because I wasn't in love with the frames.  So, I went to the fancy store at the Waterfront by the Fashion Square - Optika - to buy the glasses I had been dreaming of...  black Chanel rectangular frames with bicolor arms.  Those glasses were bucks, but I loved them.  I got compliments on a weekly basis, usually from guys.   Then one day, just months after I got them, the puppy managed to sneak them off the counter while I was talking on the phone.  I was horrified to find the mangled frames hanging out of his mouth when I heard a loud ""crunch, crunch, crunch.""  I cried.  Real tears.  I am not exaggerating.  After recovering from the trauma, I went back to Optika, but could not find the beloved Chanels.  They were ""last season"" and no longer in stock.  I tried on a variety of frames from all the big names...  but nothing spoke to me.  Then I remembered my friend Yelp.  I asked Yelp, where do I find ""cool glasses.""  Up popped Nathan S. and Sarabear B. , both touting the great selection of unique frames at Sassy Glasses.   I raced to the store to find a FANTASTIC selection of unique glasses in a modern boutique-style shop ran by a very cool husband and wife pair.  I had a great time trying on frames and fell in love with about 5 pairs.  The best part?  I walked away with 2 pairs of glasses that I love for about the same price I paid for the Chanels.

I tried one other place, wasn't thrilled and went back to my faithful source for funky frames and phenomenal service.  They're not the cheapest by any means and they're certainly not a full service eye care provider either --- nor do they portend to be.  What they do provide is an excellent selection of unique frames, attention to detail and quality service.

If you are like me and need to wear glasses every single (GD) day of your life (severe astigmatism so contacts are out, and no way in Hades am I having my eyeball sliced open with a scalpel or laser while I watch), then you're pretty much set with wearing glasses.  I wear mine every day, so I feel justified in making 1) an investment in quality, custom-fitted frames, and 2) unique frames that augment my look.  Sassy is the source for both of my qualifying criteria.

Quida & Dan (the owners) run a great little boutique.  They take the time to consult with you on getting the pair that fits your needs & wants and they'll order specific colors/finishes/models for you if they don't have them in stock.

I usually make an annual pilgrimage to SG when I get my tax return (I've never had/been offered good insurance for someone who needs something beyond Lenscrappers inferior capabilities), so I went in 10 days ago and ordered a frame (not in stock) that I knew I wanted.

I was having the hardest time parting with my previous glasses, that I had nearly five years. Their bright blue color garnered me many compliments over the years, and I just couldn't fathom retiring them. I actually got those frames at a local chain, which came as a surprise since most of the national boring chains rarely carry anything funky. 

I went back to said chain, to find more glasses, and found a suitable pair but realized soon after I purchased them, they weren't cute enough. So, given their 100% no questions asked return policy, I returned them. You would have thought I asked for a million bucks, because they were more than snobby and annoyed with my return. I vowed never to step foot in that place ever again. 

I tried shopping other chains, basically going into every single place with no luck. I quickly realized my search was going nowhere and gave up. Then around Christmas I went to a Christmas party where I saw a girl in virtually the same blue frames as myself. I immediately asked her the brand name which was Etnia, and I felt like I won the lottery. She indicated they were Italian frames and purchased at a boutique shop in L.A. I immediately knew I'd find what I wanted with that info. 

Googling ""Etnia"" in Phoenix gave me one result- Sassy Glasses. Off I went, immediately the same day, half way across the valley 35 miles to this little store. Right when I looked at their frame selection I was in heaven. It was like hitting a gold mine of glasses, I couldn't believe there could be so many stylish, colorful, unique glasses in one little store. 

The owner immediately asked if I needed help, brought me over frames he thought would look good on my face (he was right on), informed me of their sale drawers of closeout frames, and was just generally extremely friendly and knowledgeable. 

The frames are pricey. I found two frames I fell in love with. One was $390 and the other was $475. LOL! I always seem to pick the most expensive frames, so I continued looking. Sure enough, I lucked out and found a beautiful dark purple/blue frames for $200. Not only that, if I bought the lenses through them, they'd take off $100 from the frames making the frames only $100! 

I told the owners that I was looking to get my lenses at Costco to save money. They were nice enough to call Costco for me and see what their prices were. It turned out they were only nominally cheaper given the great discount I got on the frames if I purchased the full set with Sassy Glasses. Plus, they informed me that while Costco is great, they don't use the newest technology for making lenses. Needless to say, I bought the whole pair through Sassy Glasses. 

When it was all said and done, I paid $305 for both frames and lenses, which I may add was $50 cheaper than the chain store I went to the last time, and that was for practically no-name frames.

We opted for the larger two bedroom in the newer phase of apartments.  You most definitely get what you pay for. After reading some other reviews, I guess I could understand why some residents aren't thrilled with the older phase of the complex. We personally have no had issues with  any bugs, roaches or scorpions. The grounds well kept, the landscaping is always well maintained and the pool is always clean. There are plenty of dog stations to clean up after your pet if you have any. All of our maintenance request we've had (which were few) have  always been taken care of the day of with no hassle. There is always a place close by to park, in some previous places I've lived this wasn't always the case.  It's right next to North Mountain, if you like to hike this is convenient. Overall the Pointe Tapatio area is very nice and quiet, it's a little close to Sunnyslope but we haven't had any issues. Some of the things we haven't been thrilled with: The apartments themselves aren't as updated as we would like, but like I said this was the most affordable option. The newer phase is by no means outdated, just could use a little sprucing up. The fees can be a little steep. For instance, we payed our rent on the 3rd of the month (didn't plan ahead from being out of town) and it was an $85.00 charge for being late the day of. But it seems like this is just how it is at any apartment complex anymore.

Well now, it's of course the furthest thing from a brothel but you can still feel the history living in the walls and parts of the restaurant feel like stepping into a different decade all together.

Second of all, the environment. If there's a restaurant that screams party, this is it and I'm talking about a party for all ages. Whether you're visiting with family and looking for a lively establishment with plenty of patio seating, fun games and hearty food, or you're out with friends eager to share some laughs over margaritas, live music and trivia night, this restaurant's got your covered. This is the ideal restaurant for large parties, private parties and more. They have two very large patios with two outdoor bars, a huge indoor bar area, a spacious main dining room and a more private dining room in the back (that happens to be the original building that housed the brothel!) 

Third, let's talk about the activities. This restaurant knows how to keep their guests entertained! They have live music, trivia nights, bocce ball tournaments, chocolate fountains on Sundays, and special events including a fiesta bash on Cinco de Mayo...just to name a few. 

Fourth and finally, the food. The food is solid Americanized Mexican food. The Nachos are hefty, the pollo Fundido is cheesy & creamy and the quesadillas are a good greasy (the kind you want when eating a quesadilla). This food is exactly what I would expect and hope for when visiting Aunt Chilada's. It's the perfect type of food for this family-friendly, fiesta inspired establishment. 

PS - did you know that these fine folks also happen to own Rustlers Rooste...that awesome cowboy establishment in Tempe complete with a live bull, slide and two stepping? Yes, these folks know how to have fun!",review,14,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

For starters, I got here at 10 am sharp, and realized that this place is closer to my house then I thought. I know they have a couple locations around the valley, but I think they have one in Tempe aside from this location as well.

When I arrived, the place was colorfully decorated and there were people slowly streaming in. I found my group, and we all sat on the patio.  Our server was super attentive, and I realized when she handed me the menu, that they had a weekend breakfast deal with healthy good looking food.  Yes, you can order from the main menu, but they have a great separate menu for their breakfast stuff on Saturday mornings.  

The server informed us of the complimentary chocolate fountain with fruit inside as part of the Saturday morning breakfast thing.  After we placed our orders, I went inside and grabbed some fruit and dipped it all in chocolate.  They had strawberries, cantaloupe, marshmallows and a few other items to choose from.  So tasty!

I reviewed the menu and decided to go with the fruit bowl with granola and a $3 Mimosa.  One of the other girls with me ordered the same thing as well, and the others got some good looking dishes as well.

The fruit bowl came out and it was so good looking!  Holy cow! I really enjoyed the whole thing and overall, the prices and the food were awesome.  Service was great too, and I will gladly be back in the future for more.  Thank you breakfast club, you have made my day...and aunt Chiladas's",review,4,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg

Although I have not been in this store in YEARS, I have a situation where I need them. I have had 2 cats disappear, both had tags identifying that they were fixed and had info on the tags to return them to their owner (me). I just recently had to spend $150 on one of my cats who appears to have a stab mark. Initially I though it was a dog bit but the vet shaved back the hair on the wound and said it looked like a knife mark.

I know my neighbor has an extremely bad temper. He beats his dogs because I can hear him clearly. He's always yelling in his house. To make a long story short, I am afraid my cats bare the brunt of his temper. I know my cats jump on his car and he absolutely hates it. I heard him say ""get the f*** off there"" and chase one of them. He looked surprised to see me quietly sitting in my chair in the front yard.

I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...

The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.

The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.

There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.

There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.

A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.

Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. 

Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.

There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. 

I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.

Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!",review,2,t79B56n8IeVrMNmM4QU2Ow

i will have to say, for someone who doesn't get this far away from the house to eat out, it is a bit tricky to find the restaurant. we entered the first entrance to the resort on which this restaurant is located and drove around for a good 10 minutes. went up the hill, then down the hill. to the pool area and back. a staff member said ""follow the signs"" which we tried but only ended up back at the entrance. finally called from the property and were directed appropriately. 

the layout inside is very big. it felt cozy, kind of like a ski lodge with lots of dark wood and mood lighting. the bar sits up high and the restaurant is below. i ordered the calamari and it was cooked just how i like it...ever so slightly chewy, but tender enough to not wear out my jaw. then the scallop dish which was delicious with the risotto. i'm not a risotto connosieur but it tasted great to me. for desert, i ordered the chocolate volcano cake but absolutely could not finish...my taste buds said yes, my belly said no. 

the food is heavy....heavy on the butter and richness. i was full after my entree, but with the wonderfulness of restaurant week, i just simply had to get a desert. 

my wife enjoyed her farmers salad but it was very large and she had to save room for the rest of the meal; the shrimp pasta and apple pie with ice cream. all of which she loved but also said was very heavy and filling.

The other night my girlfriend and I went back for the first time since the amazing Yelp event earlier in the year. We started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio, overlooking most of Phoenix. Then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a ""Thank you for coming back to Different Pointe of View,"" which I thought was a nice touch. I assume he knew we were returning since I mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when I made the reservations weeks before. 

We were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our bottle of Champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders. We decided to split the Braised Duck Ravioli ($12) and the Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($15). There were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices. The scallops were some of the best I have ever had. 

For our main course we each ordered the Grilled Cedar River Filet Mignon ($38). The perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust, Swiss chard, roasted fingerling potatoes, smoked apple wood bacon, chives, Crème Fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction. No I didn't memorize all of that, of course I retyped it from the menu.

For dessert we split the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee (all desserts $9). It was delicious, but rather small and didn't quite satisfy my sweet tooth. The buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition, but even with those it was too small a dish. 

Overall, I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike.

Just kidding, it was really Corey, but the resemblance was pretty amazing. Anyway, I had a fantastic dinner here the other day which started off with a delicious glass of  Seghesio Zinfandel ($12) and an amuse bouche that was some sort of minty-pea gazpacho soup. Both delicious, leaving me excited for the rest of the meal. 

For my appetizer I got their Hydroponic Butter Lettuce Salad ($13) which was super tasty with the caramelized nectarine dressing. I found the the toasted pistachios one of the best parts of the salad as it helped offset the sweetness from the dressing, which was always a yummy experience in my mouth. The bread service came with choices between a foccacia and a mild sourdough to try with their three different spreads consisting of a goat cheese olive oil emulsion, some sort of pepper pesto olive oil, and a spicy butter mixture. The pepper pesto spread was the table favorite.

I ordered the Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak ($32) that come atop a scrumptious basil blue cheese risotto mixed with chopped portabella mushrooms and drizzled with a roasted tomato garlic olive oil emulsion. Oh my gosh, so good! I was debating between the Hanger Steak or the Featured Risotto, but get the steak because you get the best of both worlds! My lovely date ordered Pork Tenderloin Noisettes ($26) that wasn't nearly as exciting as my entree, but still good.

Dessert time left us trying the Classic Creme Brulee ($9) and Apples on the Rocks ($9). The creme brulee was the typical rich taste, but it came with a buttermilk blue cheese cookie! Oh man, that led to another party in my mouth with the combo of sweet and salty goodness. The Apple dessert came in a lowball glass (get it, ""on the rocks"") which was pretty cute. It came with a scoop of apple spice ice cream and a scoop of vanilla cream ontop of an oatmeal cranberry cookie and drizzled with caramel. It was good, but the blue cheese cookie was really memorable so I recommend getting the brulee for that reason.

The restaurant is located on the top of North Mountain in North Phoenix with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. This creates a fantastic view overlooking Central Phoenix from wherever you are seated in the restaurant (but if you can, request to be my the window). Also, try and come around sunset because its really neat to see the transition from day to the sparkly lights at night. There is a patio that would be fun to dine at when the weather is cooler. I find the prices to be extremely fair with portions and taste, so don't let that deter you from trying this restaurant.

Once we got up to the top, it really did feel like the place was built right into the mountain top. You can see the exposed rock of the cliffside surrounding the entrance. It was very cool. We rode an elevator to the top floor and you could see why they wanted to be as high up as possible. The view was stunning. I am sure it would be gorgeous at sunset but this was around 8pm and I personally really enjoyed being able to see all the city lights shimmering below us. The design of the restaurant is upscale but understated; they keep everything neutral so that the large wall of floor to ceiling windows is the main focus.

We decided to do the tasting menu and I am so glad we did. It was worth every penny ($80pp plus $40 for wine). The portions were a decent size and every one was delicious and unique. My sisters requested no shellfish or veal (and unfortunately I had to comply) so the chef substituted two of the dishes with something else. Our waiter was very diligent about making sure that we were all happy. We started with a piece of pork belly with wild mushrooms on a bed of bleu cheese polenta. This was a surprising first course (I think it was supposed to be shrimp) but I loved it! The pork melted in my mouth and I loved the tangy bleu cheese mixed with the creamy polenta. We had gotten the wine pairing as well so the sommelier made his appearance and explained that since we were changing up the dishes he was changing up the wines as well. He selected a very light red that had enough tannins to complement the pork and the cheese but was still light enough for a first course. This wine is not on their list but he had a couple bottles that he was trying out himself and he picked that one for us since he knew it would go with the dish that the chef had changed around for us. I couldn't believe how accommodating the staff was to their guests and how coordinated and educated they were. Second course we got a Pillsbury Rose which was also fantastic and the sommelier told us all about the history of this local winery and some stories about the AZ wine culture in general. It was awesome. The wine went perfectly with the salad we were served of assorted micro-greens with fresh currants and a tangy, fruity vinaigrette. A nice surprise was that under the greens were some hamachi sashimi. The fish was delectable and the salad was an explosion of flavors. I love dried currants in baked goods and currant jam but I have never in my life even seen a fresh currant, never mind bunches of them still on the vine. It was very cool! The next course was the fish course, accompanied by a crisp white blend. I am not a fan of sea bass but this one was cooked perfectly and it was a different type that was pink like salmon. I confess it did not convert me to being a sea bass lover but I loved the vegetables it was served with so much that I scraped up the remaining sauce with the rest of the bread in the bread basket (which was a very tasty focaccia, btw). The last course was the highlight of the whole experience. It was medallions of venison tenderloin. They were well-done (which is how I like my meat) but still completely fork-tender. The sauce for this dish was equally delectable, a sweet red wine reduction. The flavors in this dish were fantastic and the portion size was so large that my sisters had to take half of theirs home. The wine for this dish was a wonderful red that was so amazing I am going to go hunt it down and I will buy at least one bottle no matter how much it costs. I managed to save a bit to go with my chocolate cake dessert. The cake was good but it also came with a small cup of a super-thick and creamy hot chocolate that was out-of-this world. I thought it was great that we each got to pick our own dessert but my sisters both ended up not caring for theirs. One ordered the Apples on the Rocks, which is the one all the Yelpers raved about but it was completely tasteless and boring. It tasted like they had messed up and forgotten a few ingredients (like sugar?). My other sister ordered the chocolate and chestnuts dessert which was at least passable but somewhat blah. The boring desserts were not a big deal, though, since by that point we were sooo full!

I wanted to do something really nice for two of my friends on Valentine's day.  One problem though, they live in Arizona and I'm in California.  I know! I'll send them to dinner...wait, but where?  I have no knowledge of the restaurant scene in AZ.  So naturally, I jump on Yelp and start looking up restaurants.  Different Pointe of View comes up and it looks like a fantastic choice.  I check with one of my friends (she is in on the surprise) and turns out this is one of their favorite places to eat.  They are both foodies so that told me immediately that the food must be excellent.

So I found a place, but how do I arrange this so that everything goes smoothly?  Enter Catlyn, the hostess who answered the phone when I first called.  I explain the situation and what I would like to happen.  I was expecting something to the tune of ""I am sorry sir but we cannot accommodate a request like that,"" or something of that nature.  Catlyn responded enthusiastically to this idea and said she would email me the correct form to fill out so that dinner would be taken care of.  She then took my reservation for my two friends and assured me that they would be well taken care of.

Within hours the form was in my inbox.  I filled it out, preselected a bottle of wine off of the website and faxed it back to the restaurant.  Catlyn responded to each and every email correspondence  I sent her regarding my requests as well as making sure her managers were aware of the situation.  Her enthusiasm and professional manner made me feel at ease with regards to how the evening would unfold.  I knew there was only so much I could do from California so I was reliant upon people I have never met.

I spoke with Catlyn on the phone once again to confirm the reservation and that everything was in place.  She assured me everything was good to go.  I was trusting the staff and the restaurant to come through for me.  A Town Car (not arranged through the restaurant FYI) picked up my two friends on Friday and drove them to Different Pointe of View.

Friday evening came, hours later so did the phone call.  Just hearing how happy and surprised they were on the phone assured me that they had a tremendous dining experience.  They said the food was ""amazing"", the service was ""incredible"" and that they could not have had a better evening at dinner.  Their experience held true to every promise that Catlyn had made, and in turn made me me feel like the trust I placed in the restaurant was more than respected.  The restaurant went above and beyond.  I could not of been more pleased.

I am so thankful to Catlyn and the staff at Different Pointe of View who played a part in my little surprise.  Thank you for helping me bring joy to two special ladies.  The way the evening went made me feel like they were just as important to the staff as they are to me.

THE STORY: Different Pointe of View is one of the finest pieces of culture in Phoenix. Nearly every table can enjoy miles of city and mountain views that lend an understanding to the city's form so rarely found.

The wonder doesn't stop at the atmosphere, however, as the food and and drink never stop wowing. The salad options change seasonally, but be sure to include one in your meal as an appetizer or small second course. During my most recent visit, I enjoyed the phenomenal Poached Pear and Micro Herbs salad, which included a cinnamon-cider poached pear, dried goji berries, Humboldt Fog cheese, toasted pistachios, and a d'anjou pear and tarragon dressing. Presentation is one of Chef DeMuro's greatest talents, and each ingredient truly shines as it arrives on your plate. The Blueberry and Rocket Arugula salad was also a favorite, with dried blueberries, goat cheese, Marcona almonds, shaved beets, and a sweet cabernet lavender vinaigrette that was astonishingly light, floral, and fresh.

For my entree, I ordered the Vanilla Brandy Poached Maine Lobster, which came beautifully served against 3 lobster and parmesan raviolis, expertly cooked with the perfect bite. The smokey lobster buerre blanc sauce added another hearty, yet southwestern element that finished off the dish.

Of course, service is impeccable, and our waiter and sommelier truly acted as if they were happy to be serving us. We were tended to often, and frequently asked about each course. Needless to say, Different Pointe of View is just perfect for a rare, relaxing, beautiful, and immensely satisfying meal in the heart of Arizona.",review,2,EYN_yuSLhpPH8MRlRlAaCQ

We did the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing and got completely spoiled. The tasting began with a succulent lamb tenderloin, which was a bit unorthodox, but what an excellent way to start! It was cooked a perfect medium rare and garnished with homemade gnocchi, mushrooms, and beet purée. Next was a seared diver scallop with a delicious little side salad, followed by the chef's special that night- Norwegian cod. Before the main event, we were given a lemon sorbet palate cleanser and a ""bonus"" shot of their DELICIOUS lobster bisque- which, by the way, was the best I've ever had! (And apparently took 30 hours to make!) Finally, we were served a melt-in-your-mouth braised short rib. The menu ended with their famous creme brûlée and a chocolate turtle ganache. The wine throughout was just as epic- unique red and white grape blends from California and Arizona to compliment the chef's theme for the evening...which the sommelier apparently learns of as the chef goes! The portions and pours were some of the most generous I've experienced with a chef's tasting, and we somehow found it in ourselves to top off the evening with cappuccinos and chocolates before taking in the stunning views. 

Did I mention the views? The giant windows open out onto a beautiful view of Phoenix and the surrounding peaks. And the patient staff are eager to usher guests to the balcony for individual photo shoots against the incredible backdrop.

And speaking of the staff, everyone was absolutely lovely. From the exceedingly friendly hostess who brought us drinks when we showed up half an hour early, to the gentleman who smiled at us each time he filled our water glasses, the staff was top notch. Our server was a trip- so much fun and so enthusiastic about sharing the entire experience with us. He felt like a friend by the end of the evening...as did our sommelier, who was warm, laid back, and joked with us as he relayed the stories behind all the wines.

I obviously can't praise this place enough.

My sister-in-law, Kari Gibney works at Salon Surreal as an aesthetician (or however you spell it! - She does great facials, waxing, etc.).  

I am starting a new job tomorrow and woke up and decided I desperately needed a new hair-do!!  So, I thought I'd try out her place....even though I  was tempted to try out the nearby Supercuts because I am broke.  

But, I came to my senses and thought I better not take that chance and go ahead and get a good cut.  So, after reading all the previous reviews and talking with Kari I was so excited to get in (the same day I called) to see the proclaimed Bobby - apparently a hair guru.  

I have to say, it was the best cut I've had in a long time.  I had been going to another salon and paying $40 for the haircut.  It was always just okay.  Bobby's haircut was $45 and SO WORTH that extra $5!!!  He was completely friendly and easy-going.  He gives the best scalp and neck massage too!!!  My previous stylist never did that!!!

The salon is open and everyone seems very friendly - plus they have ice water, iced tea (in actual glasses instead of styrofoam cups) and cookies.... which my old salon never had/offered.   

My hair is thin and frustrating to work with because it's also frizzy/kinky/curly.  But, he gave me a new cut (I've always done some version of a bob) that is so cute!!! I love it!!!  And he could blow-dry it so it was smooth looking (without a flat-iron)!

So, I think I'll stick with Bobby from now on!
And if you need a good aesthetician ask for Kari Gibney!!!

P.S. I do want to point out - as an overall salon it's not the best out there in terms of design/decor/atmosphere - the decor is kind of outdated and it's not as serene as I think salons should be.  But, I gave the place 5-stars because for the moderate price range it's pretty darn good.  I'd challenge you to find a more opulent salon for the same prices.

The room where waxing and skin treatments are done is very zen. It is clean and peaceful .

She offered full waxing services as well as several skin treatments including chemical peel. Many different kinds of customized facials and chemical peels. 

Prices are great as well and they run monthly specials as well. Let's just say chemical peel is half price then what it costs me at my dermatologist office.  

The best at of all of this is that Kari uses PCA skin product. This skin care line is purely amazing and it has been invented locally in Arizona. It is so light weight and it recovered my skin from acnes. PCA also has aging line.

And I have been to my fair share of dentists.  First off, I am a bit of a freak when it comes to oral hygiene.  Second, I am missing teeth.

Not that you can tell, and all thanks to Dr. Simpson.  The story of why I am missing teeth is a long and agonizing one (it involves childhood trauma, something called root resorption, and even the Peace Corps believe it or not).

Anyhow, long story short, I needed to get an old bridge replaced and I had to pay out of pocket to do so.  To make matters even more interesting, I had to have a tooth pulled AND get a root canal.  This entire process could have been a nightmare, but it wasn't and that is thanks entirely to Dr. Simpson and his always excellent staff.  On one occasion I was having extreme pain, and Dr. Simpson saw me in his office during his vacation (He even had to bring his daughter in with him!  Who does that?!  Dr. Simpson!  That's who!).  He is very sensitive to pain and ensures that even the most routine visit is as pleasant as it gets.

Most importantly, my teeth look great and almost everyone is surprised when I tell them that they are false (many of them, anyhow).

It was expanded in the past year or so but I love how intimate and beautifully tacky this place is. You walk in to Magic Eye posters lining both sides of the restaurant, along with an oversized mural of mustachioed mariachis. As you can probably already tell, this place is not to be missed. 

I am loyal to the flauta combo meal, for one main reason: guacamole.  No frills, no BS; just guac for guac's sake. Heavy on the avocados and lime juice, and perfectly salted. I love avocado and tend to get frustrated when there are too many detractors that take attention away from them. This guacamole uses the perfect mix to highlight the avocados and accentuate them just enough. 

Bottomless sodas are necessary with the outrageously amazing sodium intake, and they have great soda there. Just the mix is right, I guess.

What is an Italian Sub?  Well, most places sell you a sandwich that is packed with a cheap cut of meat, such as Capicola, then maybe a few slices of Salami, and if you are super lucky, you might get a slice of Prosciutto, which will bring the cost of the sub to at least $10.

At Tony's, they offer the standard Italian sub on their menu, but they allow you to customize it to your liking. An Italian sub, is whatever you want it to be..you choose your cuts of Italian meats, and it's a done deal. I often get Prosciutto, Sopressata, and Salami, and they don't skimp on the quantity of meat either.

If I were to take the Prosciutto off the sandwich, have them weigh it, and buy just the meat, it would cost more than the entire sandwich does. This is one of the nice things about a family business, they take care of their customers. The bread is authentic, and the flavor of the quality meats really make for an authentic, flavorful, Italian Sub. The best part, is that it only costs about $6.00, which is unbelievable.

If you aren't looking for authenticity, then this is not the place for you. Authentic is the key word here, and I think that some of the negative reviews I have seen are due to ignorance and not understanding what it takes to run a business of this type in this part of town for so many years.

They have one of the biggest selections of imported Italian groceries that I have seen in town. They have everything from fresh bread to dry and frozen pasta, to sauces, imported peppers, fresh made Italian Sausages, which are amazing as well. The store is packed with goods, and there may be a little dust on some cans here or there, but come on, it's an old family business with a huge amount of authentic, imported goods. These places are what you want to have around when you want groceries that you only find in the Old World or in big cities, such as San Fran or New York City.

This business has so much more to offer and I urge anyone who appreciates authenticity and a good down to earth, family owned and operated business to check this place out and write a review that is fair and that applies to the type of business. This place should not be compared to a typical grocery store, or Subway, it's more like an under appreciated, awesome dive bar, but instead, an Italian Grocery Store...lol

I scheduled my cv boot replacement during my 2nd out of 3 oil changes. I specified that I would be on a time restraint and would only have 2 hours for the work to be done. I was assured that would be no problem at all

Well things happen, right? The company that sent the part over sent the wrong part. George said that he would have them bring the right one right away and I would still be out of there in time. Well lucky me, they still didn't bring the right part for the second time. I was pretty upset because I had to drive back to Scottsdale to pick up the little girl from school that is my charge as a nanny. So George offered to let me drive his personal car that happens to have the same size car seat I use installed in it. Since the little one I had to pick up was not my child I was not comfortable doing this. But what I nice gesture! 

So I rescheduled the service for the following day and left after two hours of my time wasted for an oil change.

The office is small.  The whole building is small but the care is great.  The waiting room has coffee, water, various flyers and information of interest to pet owners, and Animal Planet on an overhead TV.  The waiting room and examination rooms are clean.  The last one I was in had one of the vet's multiple degrees and certificates on the walls as well as a few articles that had been written about her.  

They're a little pricey for their services but they don't constantly try to up-sell you and sell you procedures your companion animal may or may not really need.  The staff are nice both on the phone and in person and seem to really care about animals versus just doing their job.

But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: 

*FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) 

*Build your own burger - not only can you pick your ""meat"" but you can pick your ""bun"" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. 

*Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) 

* Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had ""Reserved For..."" signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my ""#1 go to watch a game"" spot for all time. 

P.S. If your preference is ""fake cheese"" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)",review,11,vsXP832M0kOxKpfduD7dWw

Having phoned-in my pizza order for take-out, I stepped up to the register to pay and noticed a sign suggesting that I try a cannoli for dessert... Cannolis! Are you serious?! It's like someone took my favorite fattening foods (minus cheddar goldfish crackers & McDonalds fries) and crammed them into one easy-to-access location.  I'm sensing a lot more exercise in my future to offset the caloric intake (and yes, I did have them add a cannoli to my order)... anyway... back to the pizza!

It's probably good that I drive a stick-shift car because it was all that I could do to not grab a piece and start munching on my ride back home.

Roughly a year ago I was looking for a Vet for my rescued pooch, she needed her final round of boosters, rabies shot and micro chip.  I asked around and took the advice from a friend to give Dr. John Clark a try after a bit of research online.

Dr. Clark has been in practice in Phoenix for over 45 years. He is also currently the Board President of phoenix area emergency clinics; a group which is owned by 177 veterinarians and serves the emergency and critical care needs of over 300 Phoenix area practices. Needless to say, Dr. Clark is well respected by his peers; recommended by his clients and vets alike. 

One of the main reasons I use and respect Dr. Clark is his honesty. I have heard from two clients, who recommended him; he will not sell you on the extras. He doesn't believe in selling medications your animal doesn't need and treatments that are not necessary. So rather than a Vet that's out for the buck, he's a Vet of sincerity and integrity. In addition, the pricing at Orangewood Animal Hospital is extremely competitive and reasonable. 

The staff at Orangewood Animal Hospital is wonderful as well. I have called with questions in the past, they are always happy to help. If they don't know the answer they'll put you on hold and ask Dr. Clark, so your sure to get the correct answer to your question. If a medication is needed, they stock and sell it at economical prices. I tend to go the holistic / natural route with my pooch, so I've never taken them up on medication outside of boosters, rabies shots and micro chip. 

I have given Orangewood Animal Hospital 5 stars, so if you're looking for a Vet, give them a try!

Orangewood Animal Hospital is located roughly 2 blocks north of Glendale Road on the east side of 7th street.  They treat dogs, cats and exotics.

It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night - no problem getting a table.  The location is fabulous being right on the lake with views.  The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.

Green Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!

I had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly.  My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well.  We are DEFINITELY coming back!

The server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant.  She also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  Well done :)

Hint:  Ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake.
hint hint:  The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family and kid friendly!  They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!

I wanted to celebrate the wife's bday with a quick getaway but didn't want to stay in the usual hotel. so i popped ""lgbt friendly B&Bs"" into google and this place came up. they had a few rooms to choose from but of course the one with the hot tub in the room caught my eye first. i emailed them through the website and the owner Craig got back to me quickly. I reserved the room and then just had to wait until the day arrived. Even though we were arriving earlier than the 3PM check in, Craig was awesome and left a personalized letter and the keys to the house in the mailbox for us to let ourselves in. we put our stuff in the room and when we came downstairs the owners, Craig and Cathy were there and welcomed us to the house, even remembering that we were there for a surprise birthday trip. the house was clean and the room was nicely done. it was definitely more cozy than any hotel room could have ever been, the bed was so comfortable we almost napped thru our dinner reservation! the hot tub was definitely the highlight of the Mentor room, the massage jets were awesome and were so relaxing! in the AM Craig made an awesome breakfast complete with bacon, an egg souffle and a homemade Kringle that was absolutely delish! i couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate my gf's birthday! from the second i made the reservation until the moment we checked out, Craig and Cathy made us feel at home and provided top knotch service to us.

Our host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  

The bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  

For the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. 

Craig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.

The highlights:
- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. 
- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.
- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. 
- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs.

Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.

When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.

Has wifi. Has a (very well-mannered & clean) dog. Street parking. Does not have private bathrooms for each room, so be sure to check on that when booking if it's important to you.

Craig the owner and Coriander the springer spaniel were a warm greeting party. Craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house, the amenities, where to find him if I needed something, etc. I called him later that night after I realized I had accidentally left without a key, and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return. It felt less like paid lodging, and more like staying with distant relatives. 
Our group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members, so Craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone. One morning, the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole, so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle (?), a local specialty.

- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top
- the sauce is sweet and savory
- the cheese is rich and delicious
- the veggies were fresh and tasty

We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.

We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.

The service was casual and friendly.

In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.

Back to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  

My husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.

I explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a ""closer"" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.

Fortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.

Did I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.

The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these ""favors"" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  

As I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a ""home away from home"".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  

The manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  

There are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.

Unfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. 

I noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.

I also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  

There is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food ""to-go""  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.

Jan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  

My final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.

Until my next stay...",review,1,mDqWHJG-NQq9ycwV07wjkg

I had the special salad of the day. It was delicious, a mixture of greens with just a sprinkling of crunchy celery, and full of huge chunks of the tastiest creamy blue cheese I've had in a very long time. My lunch companion had soup which she declared to also be delicious.

Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot.

All Pets has been able to see me with very short notice, has never rushed me in and out the door, and always made me feel like my dogs were their top priority, even on busier days.

When they weren't 100% positive about something, they aren't afraid to ask each other for second opinions, which I appreciated when my dog Harry swallowed a corncob and had to have emergency surgery.

That's another thing I love about this place, is that they remember all my dogs names when I walk in the door. Not only the vets, but the front desk staff.

I didn't mind the additional kick, but you may want to let the staff know if you don't like the sensation of blackened fire-breathing between bites.

I was also pleased with the wine selection. And really, how can you go wrong with the chocolate creme brulee for dessert? Thanks, Louisianne's, for a warm, inviting dinner--and for heating me up with enough cajun spice to temporarily make me forget how blustery it is outdoors!",review,4,oAB-YHJSWJTl7gvQxN-Zdg

The food is so good, that every time my girlfriend and I consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not going to Louisianne's.

The place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way. It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.

The food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get. The appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor.

Their specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.

The only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts. This restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and I benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly consider the consequences of NOT going to Louisianne's.",review,1,Gpf8U6USRj6GzKoleb477Q

We started with the Lemon Parmesan Artichoke Hearts which were nothing like I expected but were rich and flavorful. We weren't terribly hungry so I ordered and appetizer for my entrée and my boyfriend ordered the special. I tried the Crawfish Cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake. It was tasty and would make the perfect appetizer for a table of four but I wouldn't recommended as a main entrée.

The special was the highlight of the meal. I couldn't repeat it if my life depended on it, but I heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet potato  ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini... I forgot about the rest of the menu entirely.  I'm not doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious. The vegetables were perfectly cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet potato ravioli. Then there were scallops.

Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka ""Maria's special"". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  

Service is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told ""yeah, if you can find seats"".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. 

It's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food.

When my son was receiving treatments for spine/ brain cancer, at UW Hospital, we did not  have many choices at that time of where to stay during and between treatments.

Altho we had spent time at the Ronald McDoanld house, after a time I needed to make my son feel less a patient and more like a celebrity for a day. So I decided to take a paycheck, and chose a day between visits to get a suite at the Marriott West. 
Altho my son had to use a mobile IV unit, and was scarred on his  head from radiation burns, this Marriott was most accomodating and incredible.
We had a gorgeous suite, exquistie room service and gracious attentions.
These attentions were NOT triggered by my sons illness, but sincerely born from true proffesionalism and great training.

I'm convinced that Dick & Arnie's is one of Madison's/Middleton's best kept secrets.  True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.

That said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  

The place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.

Set aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is ""cushion"" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.

Ka gives fantastic haircuts -- the wife approves EVERY time I come home -- and, especially for the price, this guy just can't be beat. As a person, Ka is considerate and focused (he has a wife and 4 kids in addition to his job at DABS), and it absolutely shows in the haircuts he gives. 

Last thing: Lisa, one of the barber/stylists at DABS, decorates the place for almost every holiday throughout the year: St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, Christmas, Fourth of July. Every time I go in, it's festive fun.",review,3,R04P35fYVS4HASyBuMcElg

To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company. Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. 

The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking. Any other time though, I promise you'll find the company much more enjoyable at Village Green.",review,0,VtN-LQRkn6gSkyQjyxkkAg

I have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. 

I have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. 

I have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!

I have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.

The only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. Its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag.",review,0,Hh5zSZtaO7mNy5N-ZhEvsw

Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes. Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).

 There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  

We are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous. Get one if you have someone to share it with.

-Calamari was heavenly and really hearty and heavy...this is not the kind of calamari that you get at Olive Garden or most Italian restaurants...this was heavenly...perfect bit of spiciness and the portion was enormous
-Scampi Gabriela...was amazing...the pasta was perfectly al dente...and the shrimp were huge...a legitimate dinner portion that you had to take home
-Bread Pudding for dessert...not at all the type that you get at other restaurants again...this was mushy and didn't resemble the bread pudding I'm use to...but it was actually the best bread pudding I've ever had...it was simply mouthwatering
-I had a glass of pinot noir with my dinner and it was a great accompaniment to my meal
One of the owners...Clarissa came by and personally asked how I liked the food and the service...we had a long chat...told her what I loved and a few pointers...she has the same name as my mom so I instantly felt a connection with her...

The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table.

No visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  

Picnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. 

A large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.

The staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.

During the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.

The gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.

So... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

Veggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5"" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread). Great price for a huge sandwich.

Grilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!

Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings. Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess.

If you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there. I always think if the mailman eats there, you know it's good!",review,1,qcuo87tjpGpoNPsLxANibQ

I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. 
One advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. 
The parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there.

The group fitness classes are offered at several times throughout the day, so it's easy to find a class & time that fit your schedule.

Meanwhile, he called ahead to have someone at the shop prep a loaner car for us to use locally until the shop opened in the morning.

We called around 8 AM, but they didn't have a report yet, so we called to have a rental car ready. We asked about whether they were open on Sundays, because that was when we would be coming back through. Although not normally open on Sunday, they were willing to make arrangements with us so we could pick up the car.

At 10:15 AM, they called to let us know whe could pick up the car in 15 minutes. We cancelled the rental and were on the road by 11 AM. Because of the folks at Prairie Land Towing, we made it to our conference, arriving only a few hours later than we planned, but without missing any major events.

I scouted a few locations, with a few places never getting back to me.  We've a large amount of family and friends for this traditional celebration so I needed a place that was both Big (enough for 300+ guests), Bold (that WOW factor when they even entered the building, foyer and ballroom) and Beautiful (for a place that would accentuate my daughter and her Epic Ballgown.)

I sent an email to Lake Windsor with no response.  Two weeks later I called, turns out my email was never received. See?  It pays to follow-up!  My contact from then on was with Ms. Jennifer Larson, the general manager to Lake Windsor Golf and Country Club.  

I need you to understand that this traditional event was very important.  I have been thinking about my daughters 'Coming of Age' party since she was five (5) and I went into the planning stages of this event early in 2009.  Jennifer and I spoke by phone and we met up the following afternoon. She was very informative, knowledgeable, and welcoming. No one had had such an event there at Windsor so she was very excited about this one!  We read and reviewed the contract, gave her a non-refundable deposit check and we were in the booking book!

My daughter Dylilah and I reviewed the menu and decided on a buffet style lunch and the vendors I worked with (Cake, Balloons Statues, Slide Show, Lion Dancers, etc.) had no issues having access to the property the day of.

Gritty details:
36 hours before I was due to close on my Madison home, the title company called me to ""remind"" me that I needed to have a cashier's check at closing to cover the downpayment and closing costs. That was the first I had heard of needing a cashier's check... when I bought my house in AR, I just wrote a check and things were good.

Apparently this title company doesn't accept personal checks, which put me in a bind, because my primary bank account is still with a bank in Arkansas. There was absolutely no way I could get a cashier's check from them in less than 36 hours. Eeek!

I have a savings account, a Visa credit card, and an auto loan with this Summit location, so I visited them to ask for ideas/help. They suggested using my debit card (from AR) to do a cash advance into my Summit savings account, at which point they could generate a cashier's check for me.

I called my AR bank and asked them to raise the daily debit limit; they did it immediately. Summit then ran the cash advance, and presto-changeo, things were golden. Total cost? zero-point-zero! So cool.

I've had nothing but great experiences here, and today continued that streak. I was truly stressed, because I stood to lose my earnest money deposit if the closing would've failed. Shaun and Summit saved the day for me. Thanks!",review,2,oFhtzLhXS1iENWoBMdWk4w

I went there because the Isthmus Annual Manual said it had great wood-oven pizzas.  I ordered their signature Benvenutos pizza (with ingredients similar to some chain places' ""supreme"") and tap water.

This was an extraordinary pizza.  The crust was explosive, the ingredients were pleasing  (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not rate on Yelp - -  where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  DULL - - you have to BUY good basic INGREDIENTS).

The truly odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics.  It is situated on a desperate strip mall, with a hideous bland exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone.  The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter.  And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange pompous facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous home-style concoctions (which you know isn't true), or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce that has ever been created

It's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly good.  A  billowing perfect crust - -  superb textures all around - -  ingredients with satisfying flavor - -  a PERFECTLY constructed pie (texture, flavor, appearance - - you name it).  Nice serrvice.

First of all, the new pricing policy is great. Three tiers: 1) standard price, 2) month-long specials, 3)markdowns straight to ""best price"" - so if you see something with the red tag you know that it's the lowest it'll be. And, wow, they are going low. 

I got my little cousin 5 shirts, 1 skort, and a pair of jeans for $17 2 weeks ago for her birthday. Yes, kids clothes are cheaper than adult clothes in general, but this was just a steal.  Last night I found a pair of M-N-G (Mango) jeans for $5. FIVE DOLLARS! And they're doing a total remodel of the store and have already installed a really fashion-forward jeans department featuring Levi's products (which, sadly, have never worked for me - but it's still a well designed department) and a really wonderful, if a bit small, shoe department.

Fashion-wise, having lived in Europe for 3 years I can say with confidence that the M-N-G line that Mango is doing for Penney's is sometimes even better than the stuff in their standard stores in the UK and Europe (I kept noticing this on trips to the US). They've also got other designer collaborations and seem to be trying to compete with the fashion-forward nature of Target, etc. while keeping hold on the more traditional department store branding as well.

I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel. Enter NOTO. What an awesome little find!

After reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!

First, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.

On to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.

The name ""take-out"" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.

The place was exceptionally easy to order from. They don't play 1,000 questions with you, which is nice. The menu is easy to find online if you don't have a paper copy. 

I admit, when I picked up our order and got it home, we were slightly dismayed at the quantity. We ordered two dishes for three people. We spend a lot of time in the Big Easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals' joints which cater to the service people. Large portions, cheap prices. 

Then we tasted it. We had the large trio (combination of a few things) and it was so good -- the flavors were great, the stuff was actually spicy, and I found I could love jambalaya (normally not a fan).  We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter. 

While the quantity was less than we expected, the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints. You can definitely see they emphasize flavor and texture, rather than giving you a week's worth of food.

You can order in advanced (at least one hour ahead of time), or you can ask for a cab to be sent as soon as one is available. The online system also allows you to track your cab (once it has been assigned to you) and gives you an estimated time of arrival (fabulous!). 

Side note: I noticed that calling the number they have listed on their website is a huge pain in the ass and the hold time is always longer than their estimate. As such, I really appreciate the new ordering system because it allows me to bypass the wait time on the phone and to avoid speaking to operators who sometimes have trouble understanding what I am asking for. 

When the cab arrives at your address, a text is sent to your phone and you are able to communicate with the driver via text (in case of delay/change of plans, etc.).

Also, since you enter your credit card number into the online ordering system, once you get to your destination and are ready to 'pay' for the ride, all you have to do is sign a piece of paper and write in the amount of tip you want to leave, and everything is set. There is no need to pull out your wallet and risk leaving it in the cab or dropping it on the street!

Thumbs up, Union Cab! I'm in love with all this technology!!

Once they called me to let me know I had left a burned cd in their disc player and offered to drop it off with me while they were out doing their pick-ups. WHO DOES THAT? These guys do. Because they are awesome.

 Another time, there was a bit of a wait (they were insanely busy just before a holiday weekend, but still smiling and keeping it cool, even though I could see the exhaustion in their eyes) because they were backed up on getting their cars cleaned on the inside before they could ok them for rent.
 I told them I didn't really care, had no one to impress, and they could give me a dirty car as long as there wasn't literally bodily fluids inside it. Save yourselves a few minutes on cleaning that, I'm probably going to put new trash and crumbs in it shortly anyway. 

They looked at me, and told me that they appreciated my sentiment and apologize for the wait, but they would feel bad about giving me a crumby car. So, tell you what. Lets just bump you up the list of cars and give you a free upgrade to a higher class of car, of which we already have one cleaned and ready.  I said that wasn't necessary, I wasn't in a rush.  They said they wanted me to have it, because I was so nice and a good customer besides. Well. I guess if you insist on a free upgrade... I'll take it. 

I like that the corporate Enterprise seems to value this sort of behavior in it's employees, and fosters a positive work environment.

For weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free moments trying to find ways to replicate it.  When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards.  When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me across the playground again.  

It was miserable.  I had started out first grade loving school.  After that day, I never once liked school again.

Everyone who works here is incredibly helpful and they will never push you to buy any services or products that they don't think you need or that they don't think are good quality. They are super woman friendly, despite being staffed by mostly men, and offer their space on some nights for a women's bike mechanics class (that I've heard of and seen, but never gone to). They built my 3-speed bike from scratch when I first moved here, gave me an excellent price for it, and have helped me to keep it well-maintained.

I am brand new to the (now less) intimidating world of bikes and cycling and broken pedals and flat tires, and these guys don't care. They treat me like I've been riding for years, yet never laugh at my questions or concerns. (And they didn't laugh when I leaned my bike against the wall and it came crashing to the ground. Or they waited until after I left to laugh, which is something I can appreciate.) I've purchased simple things (like water bottles) with them and trusted them to reassemble the bike and add pedals and air to the tires and a new saddle. All was handled professionally and quickly at, what I assume to be, a fair price.

The time came to upgrade from my previous bike (a hybrid, a bike better suited for short distances, a bike too big for me, a used bike I bought for $50 and couldn't keep fixing up, a lovely friend, a loyal commuter) to a brand new road bike, built to fit me. 

I walked into the shop on a Saturday, sat down, and said, ""Build me a Surly!"" And Earl laughed. He has no problem with Surlys, he said, and he'd build me one if that's what I wanted. But he made me do some research first. And he asked me what I'd be using the bike for. Earl and I talked for about an hour that day, and I left the shop with a few of Earl's suggestions: bikes and companies I had never heard of or considered (Handsome Cycles, Soma, All-City, to name a few). 

I still wanted that Surly, though, so I went back. ""Build me a Surly!"" Earl said he would. But I'm short (barely five-foot-two), so Earl wanted to make sure I'd actually fit on a Surly before ordering one. He called a previous customer and asked her to bring in her Surly. He hooked the bike up to the trainer, watched me pedal, told me to shift, told me to break, told me to actually ride the bike, and I did. So, he ordered me the surly. 

The whole process - sitting down, ordering the bike (the Cross-Check), picking the color (wonderful lime green), selecting the seat and pedals and fenders and, and, and - took about twenty minutes. The building of the bike took exactly a week. And it's a beautiful bike. Sleek and clean and fast and light. Put together expertly. Adjusted at least three times (Can you raise the seat? Can you lower the seat? Can you pull the handlebars forward? Can you pull the seat forward?) the day I picked it up. Happily. 

It was a dream, building this bike with Revolution. Not once did I feel pressured by Earl or the rest of the crew at Revolution. Not once did I feel belittled, talked down to, or laughed at. Not once did I feel that my dream bike wasn't cool enough, worthy enough, or good enough to build. I had a bike in mind, and Earl told me to think about it. I thought about it, and Earl told me they could do it. And they did. Professionally, quickly, expertly. And I could not be happier with the bike I've got now. 

I'll come back again and again and again to these guys because they're just that good. For everything. Fixing up old bikes, like my Specialized, and building new ones. The best.",review,3,Y_u9tbGWwEAIZs5ja8ZAzA

They have always been friendly and helpful when I have a need for my bike. However, those reviews seem to be from older dates (most of them..), so perhaps there's a management change and please give revolution a chance!!

The bike shop is a middle-sized shop, so they might not have as much variety of products as other huge bike shops. The nice thing is, they are willing to go out of the way to order something for you, even if you just wanted one piece of something. Also, it is a great place to stop by for last minute maintenance, quick fixes. They usually have a long wait for huge project fix ups, but if you just need a quick check or putting on a saddle, something fast, they will do it on the spot and you won't run into the long wait time.

I trust them to do a good job for my bike. Jacob, who I regularly see in the bike shop, was very detailed in explaining my options when I wanted to add gears to my single speed bike. He even suggested maybe building a custom bike might be something I should consider since my Sanwa is not exactly meant for touring.. A week and a half later (I was out of town), my bike was ready. It fits well, the gears are surprisingly smooth for a no gear gal like me. Everything was great!

The food has been incredible with every visit.  Sure bets: the hummus platter (wow, that IPA hummus is unreal), the waffle fries, any of the burgers, most of the specials, and of course, the fish fry.

I've had several burgers (The Abbey (with tomato garlic sauce), the Defibrillator (onions, ham, bacon, egg, cheese), and the Patty Melt) - each was delicious, and they cook them exactly to order.

I've had the Santa Fe Chicken salad - wow, those roasted veggies are great.  The soups have also been excellent - I recently had the spicy vegetable and the chili; the chili features a spice that slowly crescendos - by the end of the cup, you're feeling a little of that capsaicin love.

I've had several specials, including a turkey melt and a loaded ham and cheese.

And of course, I've had the fish fry several more times and am PLEASED to report that it remains excellent.  The hearty, perfectly applied batter and the flaky fresh cod is among Madison's best.  I will be updating my fish fry review with new pictures and details in the near future.

Seriously, this place is a dive bar, not a high-end french restaurant.  The servers sometimes double as bartenders.  You do not go to this place for the fast service, that is what people made McDonald's for.  You go for the 1lb. burgers!  They range from $7-$8.  How do they make money?

Is it the best burger?  No.  Is it in the top 5 of burgers that I have eaten?  Yes.  Definitely.  Everything is well thought out right down the to the bun choice.  The burgers all come with kettle chips.  I hate kettle chips.  Hate them.  You know what?  I ate theirs.  So good.  

Yeah, the service took awhile, but you do not go to a dive bar to get out of there fast.  The server was friendly and precise (I did not want onions, I did not get onions).  That care barely be said about high end restaurants.  It was nice to sit back and relax and then the burger came.  They are huge.  I had a cheeseburger.  I barely made it through half.  They are cooked medium well, but they are still so juicy.  The vegetables are fresh and generous.  I had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger.  

My friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  I could barely see the burger under the bacon.  It was amazing.  I dared not try that on my first time out.

If you order the bacon burger, you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it, I was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger. Amazing. 

I have also been to the Eagle Crest on Taco Tuesday. Prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see. If you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings. It's great. More than any one person can eat in one sitting. 

This is a bar people! Don't expect proper waitress service, the bar tenders are serving you most of the time. Just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food. 

Since this is a bar, maybe the best Bloody Mary in town. It comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp, a beef stick, pickle, and green olives. A meal in itself.

Indeed, Madison abounds with options for a gal like me, but Monty's marks my favorite eatery in the city. Intentionally old-school in its decor and prices, it's a throwback that appeals to anyone with a frontal cortex. 
My waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home-made veg soup as I was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn't seen me for a few minutes (aaaaand the tip started to go up).  I had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here, and good LORD the portion size was outta control. The roll was the size of a Yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato, fancy that. The meatless loaf itself was solidly good (shredded root veg with a cheesy binder - wish I had known that prior to ordering, but should've asked) but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood. So many great-looking options for veg-heads like myself, hallelujah a-MEN, and they even have a small wine list and beer. 
I couldn't get through the entire pile of food, despite being a hormonal food warrior that day, yet I craved a sweet and Monty's has soy ice cream. WTF, OTHER DINERS? I nearly wept at this one. I had the mint chip, 2 scoops, which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl. That, I could do. 
My total bill came to $8. EIGHT. I added a 50% tip and blew Monty's a kiss as I left; I shall RETURN! Waitress was a sweetie, the staff all seemed to be pretty happy, and the place was approaching fullness when I left.

There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner.

I agree it is by far the best gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on. Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.

Falafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.

Tan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...

Anyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner.

Upon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful restaurants as Salam and Semiramis...but with Donuts!  We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store.  

We ordered a lunch ""to-go.""  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.

Still, my main inspiration behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel. You will find plenty of tasty dishes, from hummus and babaganoush, to kebabs and gyros, but the incomparable falafel stands above. There aren't, truth be told, more than a few real competitors for Madison's top falafel (Banzo is also great, then it drops off), but those found at People's are really top notch, competitive with any I've had throughout the country.

The  minor league franchise only offers big league thrills.They realize that the college-level baseball talent alone will not entertain most people; it's old school baseball -- low power numbers and high strategy (like sacrifices and manufacturing runs). As a result, they focus on value and entertainment. 

Inexpensive tickets, good and reasonable food/beverages are a Godsend. I just came from Milwaukee -- three tickets with views that do not require binoculars will run you over $100. A crap beer (Miller brands) in a plastic bottle runs another $6.50. The food is overrated and also price-inflated. At the warm Warner Park, I was able to get a seat right behind the dugout (word is that they are County Stadium relics) for $10! They offer 18 different beers including incredible Microbrews collectible plastic cups for $3.50 or less! Besides great beer, there were funnel cakes, TURKEY LEGS, burgers, brats and MUCH MORE. Their wait staff (yes, wait staff) is friendly and efficient with your orders, so you can enjoy the show. 

Four mascots are always running around the stadium rally-mongering and adding to the enjoyment. In between innings, the festivities including a t-shirt toss, bat spin, children and mascot races and more. The PA announcer consistently appeals to the good-natured (but peculiar) kitsch that fills a family-oriented outing (refers to foul balls as wieners or frankfurters for no particular reason). Check their web site -- their dates are chock-full of promos including autographed balls, celebrities (like the Fridge, Webster, Chewbacca and more) and post game events.

When I was a kid I remember coming to many a Muskies game with my parents, but the crowds were always thin and no one was surprised when the Muskies and the subsequent teams folded.  Now Warner Park is a family destination as well as a popular party location.  For the last several years my company has held our summer outing here, tailgating in the parking lot before catching the game.  There always seems to be a huge crowd on the weekends.  

The Mallards organization provides an atmosphere that was missing when I was a kid.  Personally I love the game of baseball, with all of the intricacies of the pacing being a big part of the charm.  However, I realize that I'm in the minority here, because most of my friends find it kind of boring.  But the Mallards have really energized the park with the give-aways, the mascots, and all the other sideshows to the game.  My opinion is that if you want to see baseball played in all of it's old fashioned glory, go to Wrigley.  

The Duck Blind is the place to be for most of the adults that didn't bring children to the game.  For $25-35 it is all you can eat and drink in a sectioned-off area in the right field corner.  The food is pretty decent but the real attraction is the beer.  Led by local brewpub Great Dane's signature Mallards Ale, there is an excellent selection of beer.  This is undoubtedly why a lot of people attend, but it leads to a very festive atmosphere that is always a good time.  The only people not enjoying the Duck Blind are usually the opposing team's relief pitchers, since their bullpen is in the right field corner as well.  You can also win free tickets to the Duck Blind from US Cellular on the day of the game.  

Outside of the Duck Blind, the park is very kid-friendly, with various mascots running around and all sorts of things to keep the kids occupied.  The main mascot rides a zipline down from the party deck in the Duck Blind to home plate to start off the game and set the tone.  It's always about having a good time.  The various promotions include ""B-List Celebrity Fridays,"" various throwback nights and bands playing live music.  The concessions range from the traditional hot dogs, peanut and cotton candy to the truly excellent jambalaya.  The prices are quite reasonable and the people working are always friendly and appear to be having as much of a good time as the fans.

My general admission Duck Blind ticket was $33 for a Friday night game - but the experience of trying to get my money's worth was priceless. All-you-can-eat ballpark food (which is perfectly adequate ballpark food, nothing to rave about) and all-you-can-drink adult beverages (from a fairly extensive beer list)? Challenge accepted. 

There is another Duck Blind section that costs a bit more than the general admission. I think it includes a reserved picnic table and a better view of the game; however, if you're willing to come to the regular Duck Blind section soon after the gates open (90 minutes before the game), you can call dibs on a table in the cheaper section.

- I was glad to see you open the stadium for fireworks viewing after the game. Everyone was welcome, even if they did not attend the game.
- The concessions were still open and serving beer and snacks.
- Attendees could sit in the stands or have a blanket on the outfield grass (which is soft as carpet, by the way).
- There was a live band playing great, American rock songs from the 1980s and 1990s. Thank you for not playing that Lee Greenwood song!!!

That said, when I saw my opportunity to visit the Olbrich Botanical Garden when passing through the Madison area, I needed to make a stop and take full advantage of the adventure. I've really only been to two official botanic gardens (mostly CBG) however I'm glad Olbrich was another to add to my list. 

It was absolutely pouring down rain when we arrived, which was actually ok because the doors hadn't opened yet, and it also gave us an opportunity to have the gardens to ourselves once we were let in. We checked in with the ladies at the front desk and they happily pointed us to the garden areas and told us about the park; they also lent us an umbrella which was nice customer service. 
We had a plan to do a loop and visit the famous Thai garden (awesome) and our idea paid off greatly. With the rain ever-present we had our own rainforest jungle to enjoy to ourselves, which made for a very peaceful experience. We passed back around to the rose garden and detoured around the flooded pathways, so I'm not entirely sure which gardens we passed through.

After getting soaked (I'm glad I had my waterproof kayaking shoes in the car) we walked through the indoor garden, which was free because I had my membership card for the CBG, otherwise it would have been $2. Even if I had to pay I would have been satisfied, it was pretty cool. They had a variety of trees, fish, painted pheasants, a waterfall, and other hidden gems I wont spoil. 

Although we didn't make a purchase, their gift shop area was pretty nice for its size. If we had more time and nicer weather, I wouldn't hesitate to make this garden a destination for a bit. It's so close to Chicago so I can't see why that would be a difficult task to accomplish.

Chianti Braised Short Ribs (it's was ok, the meat was a bit overcooked/dry not juicy, risotto a bit too much salt.  Veggie seemed overcooked).

Braised Beef & Tortelloni (really good, I was told my coworkers would get it again)
Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce. 

Capellini di Mare (really good, didn't smell fishy, pasta was NOT aldente though, a bit overcooked for my taste).

The first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.

Oh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.

The sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.

The highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.

Smoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.  The prices are good, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect.  We will be going back sooner rather than later.",review,2,HSAur8_f6rSTsgRS_S-_rw

Walking in it's clear what your in for. Jon has rib credentials! The walls are covered in awards and certificates the guy has won. Best sauce, best ribs,  best this, best that. You don't get the awards this place has without knowing what you're doing.

I almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?). The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs. I've tried a few of the sandwiches, but I always end up coming back to the ribs because that's where this place really shines. 

The sides are also very good. The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites. I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans.

I used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago, but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date, I once again went to the Village Peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at VP. Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!

Each of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! 

I have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. 

We added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere. Once we were done, both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop. While in the store, I picked out a couple of bikes that I am intersted in, and soon as have time, you can bet that I am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense. When I have a good experince shopping, I tend to tell everyone I know, and this time will be no different. Thanks for a pleasent experience guys, I really appreciate it!

The outside of the place isn't very impressive, but some of the best bbq places I've ever been to have been dumps.  The inside is much nicer, decorated with local Wisconsin artifacts and pictures.  My favorite was the old beer bottle collection by the entrance.

Anyway, we got sat and our waitress came over right away....super friendly and super nice lady.  We asked for a recommendation and she basically went over the whole menu and said everything was great, and after eating there, I believe her.

I ordered the pulled pork lunch and my son got the fish fry.  When she brought over the plates, I knew we were in trouble...there was sooo much food! 

My son's fish was very good, not greasy but light and flaky.  My pork was excellent.  The waitress asked if we wanted a hotter bbq sauce, I love spicy, so she brought it.  Excellent!  Smokey, spicy flavor.  The sauces on the table were really good too.

I had a very specific look I wanted, and she was able to take the cute Pinterest photos I provided as inspiration and create truly spectacular arrangements using the elements I loved.  She worked hard to figure out which local flowers would be available at the time, and as a result we only had to have a few things that were sourced regionally instead of locally - very cool!! 

The flowers were all beautifully packaged and well labeled, as well, which made it easy for the folks setting up the morning of. Sally also had some great ideas that contributed to our day, as I probably wouldn't have gone hunting for vintage lace for my bouquet handle without prompting.  It made a lovely addition.  I can't recommend her work more highly, and I am so happy with the addition they made to our special day.",review,0,Kjg0nOHEstg6TrdbTFvPPA

I have never been to a supermarket that has its combination of size, local products and management.  It carries everything from value (Sentry Brands) to premium version of products.  

They also GIVE out free Sunday papers.  There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!

Every department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep. 

During the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that. 

Local foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).

The only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.  With that written, I am very picky and their deli is much superior to Copps (read my review of the very sad S. Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers. 

Although Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as ""Whole Paycheck"" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.


Tips:  

1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.

2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference. 

3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied ""gentle"" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.  I use those for my small wastepaper baskets - they look and hold up better than anything I paid Hefty for...",review,2,USSanBgta8EEQrzPY-64Bg

But that spells the makings to a great grocery store to me! The selection is second to none...especially for us gluten free folk. Produce is phenomenal. And if you haven't tried them yet their marinated chicken breasts turn a normally boring meal into a flavor explosion. (Seriously, try them.) If there's something specific you're looking for, you're bound to find it here.

Only things I'd say they can improve upon:
1. The deli counter. I know it's supposed to be super good quality deli meats but every single time I've gotten some they are pretty dry. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong kind? (Suggestions anyone?)

2. The sushi area. I've never actually tried it but it always looks a little scary.

3. The prepared foods section. I tried getting a salad or something here once and the man working behind the counter had no idea what was in anything. Since I'm gluten intolerant this can be pretty important.

I wouldn't go there for my weekly shopping, as it is a bit spendy, but once I have my staples, I will go there for different ingredients I can't get elsewhere, sustainable fish, great baked goods, stellar produce, high quality meats. If I want something special, they're one of the first places I go to.

Their policy of highlighting local goods is fantastic. There are little yellow signs in every aisle to point out products made within 150 miles or so, each sign showing where the product was made and how far way it is.  When given a choice between a few products, if I know something supports my community, I will favor it.

It's a very relaxing atmosphere to shop, too. I normally hate food shopping, but it is a pleasant experience, and I feel better when I am in there.

We'd been using a different, more expensive kennel when we had only one dog but needed a more reasonably-priced option with 2.  Hickory Hills has been fantastic for us!

It's a great value, our dogs are EXTREMELY high energy and VERY social with other dogs.  The play times while boarding are perfect and we know they have a GREAT time by how exhausted they are for 2 days afterwards!

We usually end the stay with a bathing.  Coonhounds have short, straight-haired coats but shed terribly.  Baths usually don't hold their good smell on our dogs for long, but usually with these, the smell lasts about a week and shedding is much better in the days immediately following their stay.  They do a good job.

The end product is packaged on site. 

That said, I took all of that with a grain of salt until I tried one of the finished products: the Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade.

Wow.  Blew my socks off.  The Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade may very well be the best coffee I have ever had.  Unbelievably complex bouquet and flavor: I detected floral and cinnamon notes followed by a crisp, refreshing finish.  On that alone, I ended up buying another four different types from JBC (have yet to try, but cannot wait to do so).

They are not exactly an underground bakery at the Farmers' Market,  but they certainly don't get their deserved props.  Oakhouse's delights include breads, donuts, scones and specialties are loaded.

There are other bakeries at the market including Stella's.  Based on the crowds and the number of reviewers on Yelp, Stella's gets all the love.   However, based on my consumption of their breads and pastries while also comparing prices and customer service, Oakhouse backhands Stella's with a silicone pastry brush (granted, Stella's has the moistest and most flavorful cheese danishes in the area).
 
I have always appreciated Oakhouse's efficiency and consistency.  They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.

My change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.

Next time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.  They may be -1 on product marketing, but more thank make up for it on their delicious delivery.

We figured we might end up staying a week (eventually did eight nights) so wanted something more homelike with a separate bedroom and living area. And we wanted to do it economically. The Grandstay was perfect and well under neighboring Staybridge, Residence Inn and others.

We had never heard of the chain before and found it on Expedia. It was perfect. Every single staff person we encountered all week made us feel at home. Anything we needed was taken care of. 

Being primarily a longstay hotel, you don't see a lot of the guests. We actually went a few days before seeing anyone else on our schedule. We felt like we owned the place. 

The lobby became our living room, with a nice fireplace and overstuffed chairs. The breakfast room was perfect for gathering with friends who also came in for a few nights. The pool was the highlight for our local grandaughter who came to visit.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. I also checked out the two-bedroom and one-room suites. The rooms were all decent size and very comfortable. Kitchenettes featured a full-sized refrigerator, cooktop, dishwasher and microwave.

Rooms include a complimentary breakfast with a wide range of choices including hot waffles.

The location is outstanding, with easy access to the freeway. It was 10 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to downtown. There are lots of really good restaurant choices at nearby East Towne, and a fabulous sports bar (Pooleys) just a block away.

It was after about 5 visits that we met her, and instantly fell in love with her. During each of those visits we had great experiences with the staff there - they were all very friendly, patient and helpful. We witnessed others receiving the same level of service. They seem really interested in pairing the dogs up with the right people. 

Betsy M.: perhaps your parents should revisit this shelter. Help is readily available, and there is a wealth of information about each dog attached to their kennel, and you can get their whole health folder upon request. 

Additionally, the adoption fees are almost always $175, though they are $250 for a puppy or $275-350 for a ""highly desirable"" breed (which I think they rarely label dogs as that - all of the dogs we encountered, including purebreds, were the standard $175). Considering that all of their dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, updated on most vaccinations, and given vet exams, I don't think that their rates are unreasonable. In fact, they were lower than two other local shelters not related to the Humane Society.

I have often heard how they do put so many dogs to sleep here, and it does upset me a great deal. However, rather than avoid them for that, I think it's all the more reason why we should adopt our dogs and really be able to rescue them. Avoiding a shelter because of that will not help the animals. PLEASE consider adopting before you look to a pet store or a breeder!",review,3,UVp6EOBPEW63CIzejVNjWA

It was a several hour process because my bf went to meet the dog first, and then after he fell in love with him, I came along with our other dog to meet him. We had adopted our first dog from DCHS a little over a year prior to this and absolutely love her (and yes, spoil her). 

We thought the staff handled the introduction of the dogs flawlessly. They let each dog sniff out the room alone, and then had my bf and I watch through windows as they introduced the dogs. They kept the atmosphere positive and free from distractions, while slowly giving them more and more space to interact. The dogs were buddies from the start and have continued to be best friends. 

Once again, we were thrilled with the staff and the whole process. Also like the resale shop set up in the hall, very cool!

The mix of curry and coconut was perfect....all the flavor, and the heat came, but after you tasted it on every inch of your tongue.  The jasmine rice was the perfect base for the sauce, and the beef was perfectly cooked.

I love curry and spice, but I want to taste the food too, and they gave me all of the heat and all of the flavor.  For my mom, who can't eat spicy stuff, they had enough options, and she was thrilled to get something that tasted great.

Most of the people we were with have been to Thailand, and they all agreed that this was very authentic.

They even brought out a nice traditional, homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared.

Everything I tried, I liked and I really need to go back and try more of their menu...I think I could go frequently and not get bored!  I just wish it could hit them up on my lunch.

They are also right off the light rail line, which makes it much easier for a Chandler girl to get to - no worries about traffic or parking.",review,0,66tWp8ThwPATFUxYNPyYLw

I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.

Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.

If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse and grace.

The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.

Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.

Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees.

This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. 

The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.

The Food and Drinks:
Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.

Appetizers:
We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.

Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.

Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!

Wild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.

Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.

Hot Pot:
We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.

Main Course:
I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!

Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.

Desert:
OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!

Will I go back?
I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.

I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places.
That being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger.

My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere. 

We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool. 

For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique. 

For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the ""true Thai foodie."" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. 

I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!",review,3,Ksm_R7lneKDRa0yaUoBp3A

I always order the Merry-Mu, which is a very good pork dish. I have also recently become a fan of the Fillet, as it is better than most steaks I have eaten that were three times the price at other places.

The Coconut sticky rice could be a meal all by itself, it is that good - and I am not a rice fan. Even the garnish/filler food is loaded with flavor.

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.

Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.

We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.

I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.

The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.

Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!

As for food last night, we shared an app and entree. We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our 'entree' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous! 

In previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors.

I have seen her through thick and thin, joys and sadnesses, 2 breast lump scares, abnormal papsmears, etc.  No matter what troubles and health concerns God presented me with, Dr. Johnstone was there to calm me, lend an ear to any and all of my concerns, and to move forward with appropriate treatments.

I was overjoyed last May to learn that my husband and I were expecting our first child.  I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.

Hesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.  

After I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.  My baby is due Feb 7th 2013 & I couldn't be happier I made this decision.  I could not imagine anyone other than doctor Johnstone delivering this baby.  

I have read the reviews others have posted regarding not being pleased with the front desk/office staff.  I have not had that experience.  They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.  

I would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.

A) Wearing the ring on the wrong finger so it doesn't fall off OR B) Not wearing it at all.  I say not wearing it at all, especially if your ring is as perfectly gorgeous as mine is.  I couldn't leave it in the sad little box all alone at home.

I took my new ring into a few stores to get quotes on the sizing and all of the places said I would have to leave it over the weekend because that is when the jeweler was working.  What a bummer!  The weekend is when I want to show everyone my new ring and announce my engagement.  It didn't seem like much fun to do one without the other.

Then, on a Wednesday afternoon, I decided it wouldn't hurt to check with the jewelry store across the street from my office, Renaissance Fine Jewelry.  I had a few watch batteries replaced there a while back and was very happy with the quality and speed of the service.

After showing the jeweler my ring, he was the first (and only) one to point out a few things about the ring that would cause challenges with the re-sizing process.  I was impressed.  Then he said he could I would most likely be able to pick up the ring on Friday.  That was music to my ears; I would have it for the weekend!!!

How could he do this so quickly when the other places wanted to keep my ring for 5-6 days?  I'll tell you why.  He is the guy; he IS the jeweler!  It is so nice to know that you are talking to the person who is actually doing the work!

There have never been any hassles with insurance that they have not dealt with immediately. They communicate. They are fast and they are friendly. As a former Pharmacy Tech, I can tell you that their job can be downright awful sometimes, but we have never experienced anything but great service here.

 I have used Osco, CVS,and Walgreens in the past and have dealt with lost prescriptions, crappy service, errors on my prescription labels, and other incompetencies . None of that has ever happened at this Safeway Pharmacy. The only thing Safeway Pharmacy has been lacking that the big chains have is the ability to link to all their stores, but Safeway will have that capability soon, I was recently told.

I'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did! 

Let me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.

Once we were seated, we were tempted to order the ""Limit-2"" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.

Let me stop right here.

I knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!

Once we overcame the confusion of what the ""Super Salad"" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.

For the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the ""Sam-Mex"" section of the menu. According to the menu, ""Sam-Mex"" was created by their executive chef with ""the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures."" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.

Words cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.

I'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!
 
At the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as ""white chocolate tamales,"" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. 

While I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little ""cafe"" called, Sam's.",review,2,oKFqd2Lhz37jZQgI4gdbqA

The Grand Canyon frozen margarita was tangy and superb. First time I've had a margarita dressed up with bits of fresh orange zest.

I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side.

First, the chips & salsa that showed up as we sat down - Almost impossible to describe how good this combination of sweet, spicy, flavorful and tangy this kickoff to dinner was.  You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!

Then, dinner.  And it was fast and delicioso!  I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing.  Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!

Then we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner.  She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix.  Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special.

My family and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem popped up.

It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains. 

I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll. 

Our server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world. 

We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous. You can tell everything was prepared fresh, so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit.

Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision. And lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown, cash only, and offers no warranties/returns... seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions.  But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.

Phoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking ""Made in China"" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.

Phoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.

As for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said ""He is just really fair.""  And I have to agree.  For the price you cannot beat them approximately $500 a little higher or lower depending on the model of your choice.",review,2,9Y0HHmmDdNLpflYXY-lMBg

The Basilica is a beautiful piece of Spanish colonial architecture run by Franciscan Friars, crowned with bell towers, palms, and stained glass windows.

The Christmas altar was lit with candles and bursting like a heart in love with the reds of dozens of poinsettias.

Midnight mass lasted until 2am, but was so rapt with happiness, that few seemed to mind or notice. Instead, the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense. It was like a holy party, with all of creation joining in the celebration of its Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

The mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken. There were traditional carols, Latin chants, and pieces of Handel's Messiah. The choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one power.

The celebrant was Father Vincente Mesi whose beautiful, crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of Christ's birth as well as the Gospel reading from the pulpit.

By 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news, pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall, dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of Phoenix. The bells sang the happy triumph, the surprise victory of love and meekness, over the pride and might of the world.

Many, though no doubt not all, felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding. Many, though no doubt not all, walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy. Those who did were at least for a moment transformed by this eternity--this holy party which is Christmas.",review,5,xESy7H7UhTS2EXiuOQ1Z5Q

It was average price-wise for museums these days so I don't knock it for that. When you fully explore every part of the museum I felt it was worthwhile.

I don't profess to be an expert on Native American history (save Geronimo) so if your knowledge is a bit lacking in this area then this is the place to help fill in the gaps. It was definitely a lot of learning for one day but enjoyable and eye-opening at the same time.

The mock school area of how native americans were forced to integrate was probably the most fascinating part for me. As much as the fact that it was only a few decades ago that the school closed. You usually think of this in the Wild West over a hundred years ago.

Why this isn't a sell out crowd every day makes no sense to me.  Herberger has been doing it for years and I swear I am going to do this regularly, and I don't even work downtown.

It's from noon to 5pm and you will see Live Music, Food Vendors, Wine Tastings, Film Shorts,  Children's Activities and my favorite, Pet Adoptions.  I hope to see you all out there. This is the best way to experience the Herberger Theater for the first time if you have never been there before.

Weekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.  And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.

But while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).  The spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates to late-'80s pop ballads makes for a great party-like atmosphere.",review,1,TgelMbtOYOT8MBvTy6Kp6g

The owners and staff are all incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive. This store has a wonderful atmosphere, a very local and family-owned type of feeling. 

The selection is not as big as a mall jewelry store, however, it is obvious that they know what sells, and carry only that. They have a wide selection of precious gemstones (including sapphires and tanzanite), set in earrings, pendants and rings.

They also offer a good selection of wedding band sets, and in designs that are both unique and timeless. 

In addition to their fine jewelry they also offer costume and sterling silver jewelry as well as assorted trinkets and home decor. 

I came in to have a pin put back into a watch and the service I received was phenomenal! They were able to repair the watch within minutes and at very minimal cost... literally next to nothing! 

It is nice to see a local jewelry store going above and beyond to help their customers! This is what makes a local store so much better than a chain store, and you know that your jewelry is in good hands here.

The chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean.

There were some big production numbers and every detail was perfectly arranged and presented.  I wish I had a photo of that final scene were everyone is dressed in their red and white or green Christmas costumes in front of a large tree and lighted wreaths, with snow falling in the background. Gorgeous.

As for the theater, it was surprisingly small, which turned out to be a real treat as the proximity to the actors made the production more enjoyable rather than viewing it from a distant balcony or 60 rows away.  There is a very nice bar, and there was live music prior to the show.  At intermission, cookies, chocolate squares, and brownies were $2 -- about the price range as other theaters in the area.

Parking did not seem to be a problem, but finding the lot and theater was not clear at first.

And who better to accompany me than the lovely Terry T. Incidentally, Terry has seen the production multiple times, so I was concerned this wouldn't hold up to her expectations. I, on the other hand, was just excited about seeing this musical (and staying out late on a work night, Tee hee!)

Now, I have to admit I started comparing this production against the movie. So I initially was thinking, ""Wait, Fontine was brunette"" and ""Hugh Jackman delivered that line differently"" before I allowed myself to be consumed by the musical. Because it truly was beautiful and masterfully played out on the modest sized stage. It received Terry's seal of approval. Bravo!

A couple of things I think really contributed to my enjoyment of this musical were 1) the lovely senior citizens who were bused in, and their darling commentary during the production; and 2) killer seats, front row stage left.

It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips.

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.

It could have easily fed two people, but if it is that good, why share? I love places like this. Simple restaurant specializing in something they do best, and this is the place to come for teriyaki. My food arrived at my patio table in less than 10 minutes. The salad had a delicious citrusy/sesame tasting dressing that mixed well with the rice and chicken. Chicken was so tender, and the teriyaki was neither too sweet or salty! Perfect taste. Since I like super spicy food, my only regret was not squirting Sriracha sauce all over it. However, I didn't realize that until AFTER I was half way done with my meal. It was so flavorful my spicy craving didn't even kick in I was way too full to continue on.

4768,kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ,0,2012-07-15,0,1CgeYf0pL8pn4vCkukpGQQ,5,"A few weeks ago, an old friend and I made plans to meet up for lunch. Problem is, I essentially live in North Scottsdale and she is in Buckeye. Using Meetways.com to find a halfway point, I then took the results to Yelp to see what restaurants are in the area (I prefer to find the good local places, rather than a chain, which I'm sure is true for most Yelpers). Anyways, saw the great reviews and decided to check this place out.

We both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious as others have said. Very nice portions too as neither of us downed the whole bowl. Where this place really shines, though is the service. An older woman, who I'm guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned, was walking around conversing with the patrons. It's a small place so she was able to check with everyone on multiple occasions during the time we were there. 

Her service was absolutely delightful. When I received my food first (I had ordered a couple minutes before, so my friend had just finished ordering when I got my meal), she came over to the table and informed that the young lady would not think I was rude if I started eating before she was served. A moment later, she came back with my friend's food as she told us that she ""has pull around here"" lol. I'm guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer, so sorry about the added wait if that's the case, random stranger. A while later she came back to give us free refills of our large drinks. 

I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again, and might have to order something different. A wonderful experience that was truthfully what motivated me to actually sign up for Yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an ""outsider""

The only negative was that the parking is very limited, but then again I did go during the lunch rush. My friend was able to get a spot in their lot but I wound up having to park in a different lot just north of it. It was maybe only 30 feet further away, I just wasn't sure if I would be towed or not.",review,0,Mx-sM8KX667x9EMmrj8NsQ

Whole meal was like $10 too, and that includes a ""medium"" lemonade which is actually HUGE!! Seriously, get a small lol

Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! 

We had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!

I picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot!

But enough about me. You want to know about Blue Fin, so here's the lowdown: 

- Super clean digs and friendly, wonderful personal service from the most adorable little ladies.
 
- Tender (non-bouncy) char-grilled teriyaki chicken thoroughly marinated in a not-too-sweet sauce that tastes slightly fermented (in the best way) with a touch of sesame. 

- Great steamed veggies that melt in your mouth served with perfectly cooked brown rice.

- Flavorful miso with generous chunks of tofu.

- Wonderful house made sauces. My favorite is the sweet and sour sauce, the kind they serve with spring rolls and dumplings, it's tangy and full of fresh ginger.

- Affordable prices, generous portions, and great for healthier mid-week dinner take-out if you can get there before 6:30.

However - after a friend of mine told me that I was crazy and that the food was delicious, I had to try it.  Now I've eaten there three times this week.  

I should also probably mention that I usually hate all things teriyaki - it's disgustingly over sweet and I can't understand why people like it.  BUT this place has it right - it's fresh, not out of a jar, and made by the sweetest people you'll ever talk to.  Try a chicken bowl with extra veggies and brown rice - you won't be disappointed.

I am a creature of habit so I get the same thing every week: A spicy all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl ($6). The portion is SO big.

I love the way the chicken is cooked and the spicy teriyaki is just the right amount of spice. 

I will also sometimes splurge and get some dumplings ($2 with tax) which always come out very hot and taste great with their soy based sauce. It's not a traditional dumpling sauce that I love but it's still pretty good with the dumplings.

The service at this restaurant though is what pushes me to give them a top notch rating. The people here are just such genuinely nice people. They are very helpful and they get your food out quick.

An unassuming building in a slightly questionable but slowly emerging art district encloses a cafe/gallery/artists-haven that serves unique sandwiches with daily specials, a full-service coffee bar, free wifi and live music. The space is quite small, especially on nights when there are musicians performing, but that just adds to the intimate and welcoming atmosphere.  The staff is extremely nice, friendly and very accommodating, and the clientele are the same.  

On my first visit there I had the olive bowl (watch out for the olive pits!), the paprika turkey sandwich and their unique daily soup special-- chipotle salmon chowder.  The turkey sandwich was delicious and the soup was a bit spicy (duh, it had chipotle in it!) but very interesting, with flavors I've never experienced.  I ended the meal with a cafe mocha, and I must say what a way to end a meal.  This was the BEST mocha I've ever had (that is why I am giving this place 5 stars!!!)

There are such great little spots sprinkled throughout and I think Paisley Violin is my favorite. I've been there a couple times. Once at night while there was a band there, which was cool. I felt kinda bummed that time cause I had no idea they didn't serve alcohol, but I did find out that they were byob. The band was cool. Food is good. Tea is good.

I went during the day recently and had a really good lunch and was able to have a really chill lunch meeting. Our waitor for lunch was super friendly, helpful, and had a good pulse on when to check in and when not to. 

The best part was afterwards we walked out back and the woman I was meeting with asked if I knew about the small houses/cottages out back. Apparently, they are cottages from the Japanese Internment Camps in California. And they were some of the larger ones for families. The man who had invested in the project (I guess the owner of Paisley came up with the idea and pitched it to this guy) led us around and told us about the space and how they were going to be renting them to artists. Kind of cool, I thought...cause in some ways incredibly dark and reminiscent of something horrible...but at the same time...a way to kind of capture and convert that energy and remind people of the atrocities that have been committed when motivated solely by fear rather than logic and reason.",review,4,MwJVSTsUB-htphNZaIC43g

The Paisley Violin is gills full of progressive and retro designs and a charmingly simplistic menu of favorites, including eggwiches, croissants, sandwiches, salads, and plates containing VERY fresh ingredients like organic vegetables, cheeses, cured meats, hummus, and a variety of sauces to name just a very minimal amount.  The prices are lower than what would be considered 'reasonable' and the service is quick and attentive but not overbearing.

However, the REAL reason to visit The Paisley Violin is for the incredible ambiance, whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art, books, and counter snacks, or outside on its expansive, heavily shaded patio, complete with an artistic fountain and 6 tiny and freshly brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right there in their back yard.  According to our server one house will contain a flower shop; one, a bookstore; and the another, a tobacco shop.  The other three are TBD.  It is a brilliant concept, which makes their back patio seem infused with organic commerce and street life, but without being invasive or 'busy'.  I absolutely cannot wait for these places to open, sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso (my gf's signature drink called a 'dirty chai latte') and gazing at these magnificent store fronts, each painted in a wide palate.  

One other note: The Paisley Violin is no longer BYOB, as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve, get this, their LIQUOR LICENSE!  Fans of The Paisley Violin will appreciate that spirits will now be available -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell of a bargain to rent their space for the evening.

Now, my five stars does not mean it is perfect, it has flaws that I will mention, but I do not believe your Phoenix experience is complete without a Friday or Saturday night visit to this lovely establishment. 
The first time we walked in it felt like Cheers, everyone said hello, the musicians, the bartenders, the bar patrons, as if we were old friends returning from a long trip. Now look, it isn't pretty inside, it's divey, a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed, but look past that and see this place for what it is, a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you. Good drink, great food, great music, great atmosphere, great service.
The toasted pesto brie was delicious, the brie was not overpowering, and it complimented the pesto just right. Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good too, but not all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it's highly recommended.
Now the bad, aside from the place being divey, which isn't bad to me but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind of a nightmare. Last I went I had to park in front of a very ghetto looking house with a guy cleaning his shotgun on the porch. Paisley Violin is not in a ""nice"" part of town, and with only a couple actual parking spots, you will be parking in a strange neighborhood in front of a stranger's house... sorry.

We got here right at noon. There was apparently a conference going on in Phoenix the same day because there were people everywhere wearing badges from different universities from all over the world. This place was PACKED. I could tell that the staff was not expecting this rush because they only had 3 servers and 1 bus boy and every table and chair in the house was taken.

We were told we would have to wait 5 minutes for a table, but 30 seconds later we were walked right in. As I mentioned, the place was PACKED and every single one of the servers had a glow about them from running around like crazy. They were HUSTLIN' and they did an impeccable job. 

Because there were only about 3 servers on staff this day, each server was responsible for one third of the restaurant (and it is HUGE). Each of them was helping the other out; I saw them running one another's food, and clearing plates regardless of whose section it was.

Our food arrived moments after we ordered it, and despite the fact that the restaurant was slammed, everyone was very pleasant. They made sure to smile in between their sprints to and from the kitchen.

It was a wonderful experience dining at Mi Amigo's and we actually ended up going twice over the weekend because we enjoyed it so much.

The Chips & Salsa
Mi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.

MY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO
I've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.

Yum. I also appreciate their convenient variety of snacks and candy, even Tylenol if you need it. They serve coffee too, although I haven't tried it yet.

Its a pretty basic sandwich shop, that caters to students and employees at ASU's Mercado buildings on Van Buren, and to a lesser extent the UA College of Medicine across the street, and Heritage Square. Its too bad the storefront is so hidden - you have to know exactly where you're walking or you'll miss it, and its not at all visible from the street.

I'm not sure what upsets everyone so much about the prices - this isn't Subway, their sandwiches are much more substantial, and you get chips (plain Lays potato chips) in the bag with your sandwich. Most of the sandwiches are between $6 - $7, but that's what you'd pay at Corner Bakery or really any non fast-food-chain or sandwich shop these days. Also, it's a local business for goodness sake, in downtown Phoenix no less, so consider the fact that they represent exactly the kind of economic activity this part of the city needs. There's some cheaper pre-made sandwiches and snacks for sale if you're really so concerned.

Despite having just compared it to generic fast food, the service really is quite fast. Unfortunately, there isn't room in the tiny shop for any tables, but you can order a sandwich and they'll have made it in 2-5 minutes while you wait.

The owner, Tom, is there almost every day, and most of the employees are very nice and will remember your order if you go there frequently.

Also, they just replaced their cash register with an iPad and use Square, so they will swipe your card on the iPad and sign with your fingertip, OR (even cooler) you can use the Pay with Square app and never have to take out your wallet at all.",review,1,mSpMEAm6xUS6bG8qDT5giw

I have to say my absolute first impression when I walked in was not super great. No one really seemed all that interested in helping me. Maybe it was just me, it could have been that they had JUST opened their doors and were still getting situated..I don't know. At any rate I left there less excited about banking with them than when I walked in but it did not take long to turn me into a HUGE fan. I can't see myself going to any other bank again thus far. Customer service has always picked up right away whenever I have called,  I even sent them an email and I am not sure it took them 10 minutes to reply.  They have relationships with several other credit union branches that I can walk into and make deposits and transact business with, so even though they only have one ACCU branch near me who's hours are not convenient for me there is another CU about a block that they co op with that is open on Sat and I can go in there. That stuff is all really great but what really did it for me was their website and mobile app. My, now former bank, was not even close to this easy to use and ACCU's website is actually very useful  to me. I am a bit of a tightwad with my cash and like saving my money, this website makes it SOOO easy to track my spending and help me make adjustments. I also used to have to have a paypal account to easily send money to people as my old bank just used to have your everyday  bill pay that every bank has. The payment system ACCU has rivals PayPal in my opinion, for how I have used paypal in the past anyway. Like I said my overall first impression was not super great, I was actually sort of leery about closing my regular bank account after my first meeting but now I almost can't wait to close it.

The way they were throwing the sandwiches together reminded me of Primanti's in Pittsburgh. They had a no nonsense-we know what we're doing-kinda attitude. There was no frufru on the menu, just great meat with a few ""specials"". I got the skyscraper which was a great, fresh bun piled with corned beef and pastrami. Then a slice of swiss and some deli mustard. Perfect! I grabbed a side of sauerkraut and a drink. We sat out front and I can just simple say that everything was just perfect.

Well I walked in and it was empty which usually isn't a good sign but it was 2:00 PM and I figured the lunch rush had come and gone by then. Besides the lack of people I did notice how clean and organized everything was, I liked that! I spoke to the gentleman behind the counter and asked him what the most popular item was and he said the Pastrami or the beef brisket. Since the boyfriend eats anything I got him the Brisket and he offered up some fries with that. I had a hard time understanding much of what he was saying like types of bread for the sandwich or whether I wanted a pickle with the meal but no big deal. Well to put it lightly the Brisket was friggen amazing.

Now, you have to be on your toes when ordering as they move pretty fast, which is understandable considering the big lunch line.

The 930 service features more contemporary music.  

A few things really stand out about this church. First, the music. The volunteer choir performs breathtaking choral pieces every Sunday. Even after attending this church for a year, I'm constantly impressed by the skill of the choir, soloists and organist. The service commonly features guest musicians such as the Sonoran Brass Quintet.  

Secondly, the current pastor, Pastor Larry gives great, contemplative sermons that really parse the text of the scripture. The staff and congregation are always friendly and welcoming, and the church is involved with several charitable works in the community, such as the Justa Center

for it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.

fresh ingredients, so good.

My friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.

they also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment? oh yes pls.

I've been here probably about 25 times since my first visit and now exclusively get ribs.  The sides in my opinion aren't really worth mentioning.  The coleslaw had as much black pepper in it as any other ingredient and the cowbro beans are kinda spicy.  The mac n cheese is good, not kraft or velveeta but not special.  The ribs are definitely the way to go for a happy full belly.",review,0,A8e50wVP7xcz1sWOE6gEbQ

I've been a customer for decades, having started when the owners and founders were smoking meat in a converted 50-gal. drum outside the original East Phoenix location.

I now frequent the Central Ave. location and the food is still as good as it's always been.  

If all that matters to you is ambiance, this is probably not the place for you. Honey Bear's is all about the food.

Someone complained that the pork was too soggy.  Another that the pork was too dry.  HOW can it be both??  The pulled pork IS ""soggy"" because it's JUICY!  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE for!

Someone actually dissed the barbecue sauce!  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west, and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found.  

The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth), I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs.  So, I tried the spare ribs and, while they are good, they just don't compare to the baby backs.

I had never tasted ""collard greens"", so I decided to try them.  Now I'm hooked.  Since I liked them so much at HB's, I ordered them when I went to Notorious P.I.G., another barbecue restaurant. I had to throw those away...they were loaded with vinegar.

I will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork, pulled chicken, and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants).  And, for other HB's fans, ""Deal Chicken"" frequently offers coupons for Honey Bear's which cost $15 for $30 worth of food.  Beat THAT!",review,2,kLb4zT15uKva0WF9wfzDng

To top it off, the bathroom is unisex... and sneaky. Behind a wall without a handle, you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way. While waiting for an open room (there are two private bathrooms once you're inside), a couple men profusely apologized. Evidently, they thought they were in the wrong bathroom.

Windows surround the building to the east and north. You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by, cars and the light rail. The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle. The cheeses are good, though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite, and I haven't heard of most of them before going here.

Husband and I went here for a late dinner last night on our anniverary-eve. It was a Monday, and there were only two other couples there, so it was nice and quiet. The ambience is relaxed and warm, and our server was attentive and informative, but not smothering.

We started with a three-cheese plate. They have a long list of cheese varieties from which to choose. We got the Truffle Tremor (goat), Abbaye (Sheep) and Three Sisters of Serena (cow). It comes with baguette slices, pear slices, strawberries, grapes, dried cranberries, almonds, and a delicious candied-syruppy-dried-fruit-and-nut combination.

I ordered the duck for my entree, and it was superb. The duck breast was excellent, but the best part was the blue-cheese-potato croquette and the diced mango and poblano relish. I could have licked my plate. 

We were too full for dessert, but they looked great.

I loved that you can order half-glasses of wine. It gave me a chance to taste a couple of different kinds without a)breaking the bank, and b)getting so sloshed that I couldn't drive home.

I enjoyed everything about my experience here. The only drawback to the entire meal was that the server told us that the mac-and-cheese plate was big enough for a meal, but when it came, it was actually pretty small (perfect size for a starter). Husband insisted that it was just enough, but I would have preferred he have a bigger main course. But I digress.

Expect to pay upwards of $50/person if you go all out and order wine, starters, and entrees, but this could easily be an affordable dinner at happy hour or if you just get a few starter plates to share. The portions are adequate, but not really big enough to take home leftovers.

One of the things I love to do at Cheuvront's is the tastings.   Wine tastings, cheese classes, beer tastings... it's all yummy, PLUS super-fun, and very informative too.

Cheuvronts has been through a couple of different chefs, but the food is always consistently made from ultra fresh, premium ingredients.  My favorites include just about any salad on the menu, and the salmon, mmmm.    

The cheese selection is, bar none, the best in Phoenix metro.   I didn't say it was the cheapest; but it is definitely the best selection of some of the most fantastic cheeses I've ever had. 

I highly recommend going to a cheese class to learn more about cheeses!   Ken Cheuvront is extremely knowledgeable and has travelled to most of the places where the cheese is made and has personally met most of the cheese makers.   So that makes for some great stories which make you appreciate the cheese even more.

There are great happy hour deals on both food (starters) and beverages, and on Sundays and Mondays the happy hour prices go ALL DAY.   Unbelievable deal!

I have been meaning to go for ages and finally a group of friends wanted to go out of dinner, two of them which now live downtown, and I recommended Cheuvront. A half hour ride from the Mill Avenue stop and I was there. 

A bit chilly to sit outside but looks like excellent outdoor seating. The seating is well spaced with wine storage along the back wall and a well stocked bar in the middle (God and I both love a well-stocked bar, or at least I always say ""Thank God, they have a bar). The wait staff was cordial without being too personal (I look at dining as I'm out to eat dinner with friends, not really out to make new friends, at least until I have a few drinks but that is whole different situation....ahem). 

I started out the evening with a basic mojito made with 10 cane rum. A little too much sugar syrup for my taste and could use more lime but wow, served in a full size glass and a kick like a mule. One of my fellow diners had the white sangria with fresh basil and wow, that was a keeper. I'm definitely having that next time. 

They have a huge selection of cheeses from around the world and we ordered the three cheese appetizer plate (the waiter asked if I wanted to pick but was happy to pick a selection for us, and I love to delegate) and the pork empanadas with orange marmalade. The cheese was good and I noticed they also have another book where you can order wine and they just pair it with cheese, how cool! The empanadas, to die for, I will order that again, ideally along with that sangria with fresh basil. 

Dinner was the duck breast rubbed with coffee and ancho chili pepper and served on top of I don't know what but it had a crispy grilled crust on the outside and it was nice and cheesy (seemed like some sort of rice and cheese mix) on the inside, and it was wonderfully presented. I actually had the recommended wine pairing and wow, it went so well together. A rich red wine that offset the spice rub on the duck breast perfectly. 

We ended the evening with coffee and desert. The coffee was okay but they should consider serving coffee roasted at the Cartel coffee lab in Tempe (which I love) as the coffee here was just...coffee...which was a shame when the rest of the meal was so great. Ideally they should bring everyone an individual french press so they can let the coffee get as strong as they like to drink it. I would also recommend a thicker cream, even whipping cream (unwhipped) since it provides that sense of luxury that goes well with this place (I had that at Mucho-Gusto and became an instant fan). 

For those of the more intellectual persuasion, I noticed this place is in walking distance of the main Phoenix library. So you can go pick out a good book on a lazy Sunday and then walk over to Cheuvront for some wine and cheese and feel like the perfect elitist, before you ride the light rail home (okay, this is my ideal lazy Sunday and I've always dreamed of being just a little bit of an elitist - I'm not perfect).",review,1,aIAjAU-6NH583EkQ6E9KRw

Great place for a romantic dinner...hint hint for Valentines day. A reservation is a must for special occasion days. 
The wine tasting was sectioned off from the rest of the restaurant but the service was still exceptional. Got to sample 5 wines and a tapas for $15.  They offer their regular menu during the tasting also. I tried the fig and Brie bruschetta. A great sweet paring for the French wines. I also had a prosciutto and Gouda topped with onions and capers a great pairing for savory wines.  The table I sat with also had a ham and gruyere grilled sandwich which was fabulously amazing.  
The food was just as great as the service given by Stephano.  He was always there to fill the water glass, take an order for food, and just to make sure everyone was ok always with a pleasant smile and he kept great eye contact. One of the best servers I have encountered in a long time.

 I like how the women get into the theme, with cutoff denim shorts, black tanks and tees and AC eye makeup. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful but I want to make a special shout out to Susie. She took outstanding care of me. I decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion/recommendation...it was wonderful: creamy, great flavor, not fishy smelling or tasting. Onion rings would have been a great side (hint hint). I wasn't familiar with Kilt Lifter and she gave me a sample with my Hefe. It was so good I had two full glasses. Susie was attentive without being overbearing AND invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia. Good waitress/bartender she is, she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated.

I especially liked the decor - a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of Alice Cooper influence.  The music totally ROCKED.  The restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale. Maybe a bit overpriced but hey! they're in business to make money.

The first time there was a Tool concert at US Airways that night so this place was packed.  (Is Tool in a similar music genre to Alice Cooper?  I don't know.  Anyway...)  the wait for a table was long, but luckily bar outside served food and the line moved faster than I thought it would.  We ordered the Wildcat sampler and it was delish.  Their fries are and potato skins are crispy and flavorful.  Also, their prices are not bad.

Our second visit was on a Friday night.  Wasn't too busy, which made me happy.  Plus, our waitress was attentive and friendly.

I have made it a habit to come to Cooperstown prior to ball games and concerts for over 15 years. I anticipate keeping that tradition for years to come.

So many of the sports themed bars and restaurants in this area are lost to the culinary Sonoran graveyard.  Alice Cooperstown still stands for a reason.  The staff is friendly and fun loving, the menu diverse and in unison with the rocking roll and sports themed decor. 

I usually get the BBQ sampler or the incredibly stacked nachos, but tonight I went for the simplicity of the Tom Brady Burger.  It was ""Spot On."" 

The bacon was crisp and plentiful and the burger itself was perfectly cooked with a smoky charbroiled taste.  The fries were fresh, crisp and spiced perfectly. 

I opted for two Kiltlifter beers, from local microbrew Four Peaks Brewery.
The beer was available on draft served in nicely chilled her glass. 

Giant screen television monitors are strategically placed throughout the cavernous restaurant so every seat can view the game or games. 

The only negative remark actually is as a result of their popularity:  You may have to wait a while on big game or concert nights, plan for that contingency arrive early and enjoy the fun.

This is my place all summer for Phoenix Mercury games.  We love loud it can get in here.  Players have said that this is one of those arenas where the crowd definitely becomes the X Factor because the volume on the court can get more intimidating than some other Arenas.  As it should be.  

I've seen lots of other concerts/events here too over the years and it can go from feeling like a small casual place, like during the AND1 Basketball Tour to an upscale ""adult"" spot, when Billy Joel played it, to a rocking explosion - Melissa Etheridge rocking the place down.  This place does a great job of just ""matching"" the appropriate mood of the night.  

While the food stuffs are generally open for the Sports events, there are some nice options. The Copper Club has some nicer options, though still quite casual.  There is a new wood fired pizza place that is actually really good.  Of course you've got Subway, McDonald's and Cold stone too.  

It's a great spot for any event.  Personal opinion though - if you are going for a sport event you have to sit in the bottom 1/2.  There is such a huge difference in the seating that it's absolutely worth it - even if you're in the last row on the level.",review,0,l53FUDHRHLg7BQ89KgAtxQ

It was my first time at US Airways Center and I will definitely be back if any other artist I enjoy comes to perform. I used the park and ride on Washington just a few blocks East and rode the light rail free about 45 minutes before doors opened. Once inside the lobby I must have dropped my ticket because I had them in my pocket, (don't like bringing a purse to concerts!) and within a minute or two of talking to one of the security guards and an employee at the front another woman came up that worked there and when she found out I had dropped my tickets she told me she picked them up and put them in the back inside the customer relations office. She walked me back and I had my drivers license out that had my name that matched the one on the ticket and without any questions she checked the names, handed them to me, and I was on my way! Talk about total perfection from the staff. That will teach me to use something other than tiny jean pockets next time! 

The seats had a perfect view, section 105 row 19, and we got to look right down at the stage and had a lot of room to dance as we were on the end of the aisle. The show was outrageous and a great experience all around. 

A few small side notes, the bathrooms are huge and clean. The food all smelled pretty tasty but I was not in the mood to stand and eat, and I'm sure it wasn't cheap either. Drinks were priced a bit high but I was driving so I didn't have to worry about opening my wallet anyways! Once the show let out it took a matter of seconds to exit the building and get to the light rail station to go back to my car. I guess a lot of people had the same idea because at least 100 or more of us were waiting in a huge group, and once it arrived and the doors opened we were squishing in but everyone was still on such a high from the exciting show that we were laughing about it.

There are different vendors that sell food and drinks in the halls past ticketing. The variety depends on the event.

They are not big on mixed drinks or coffee options, but you're in downtown Phoenix..... Once you walk out you have lots of options, so just have a beer or a coke and bide your time ;) 

Parking is EASY. It's literally surrounded. If you've never been it's easy to get scared when you're driving up because you start to see EVENT PARKING signs blocks away, but fear not! There is plenty of parking directly across the street North and West of the building.

I had the Korean Beef tacos.  Love it.  Good flavor, and rather large portion.  (TIP from my Auntie, ask for potsticker sauce on the side and pour it on the rice and/or tacos) 

The customer service was great, our waitress was super friendly and conversational.  Since it was pretty much empty, we walked outside to look at the stadium from the balcony they have.  While we did that, another employee got confused and cleared away our drinks and utensils.  Our waitress noticed before we came back and replaced it all.  She also took our picture outside for us.  Shame I dont remember her name to give her recognition on here. 

Overall, 

Food- 9/10
Price: 7.5/10
Location- 10/10
Customer Service: 20/10

-Piebald.  Super fun!
-The last Suicide Nation show with Jeromes Dream, Usurp Synapse, and Racebannon.  Seriously some of the most intense sets ever.
-Love Life and Get Hustle.
-Getting drunk outside while my friend thought he gave a homeless person his car keys in a handful of coins from his pocket.  After breaking his passenger window with a brick, he found them in THE GLOVE BOX.  Who puts their keys in the glove box?!
-More recently, any time I walk through it now during First Friday to see some (usually) wonderful artwork.

Last night we saw again the wonderful jim Witter who did a tribute to one of my favs of all times, Simon and Garfunkle. ( I know every word to every song they ever wrote. Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music. 
( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like ""Just Jack"" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  
   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?) 
   However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!

Oh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can't remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever. I have no idea how a man can even hit a high note like that. If you ever have the chance to see him do this I would strongly advise you to do so. It is so fun!",review,0,tBvrnSCLSpUdCDm5w5GPkg

Here's a couple of tips if you want to go. 
1) Bring cash for parking. I'm not even sure where you would go if you didn't have any cash to park. It'll cost roughly $12 to park in any of the nearby structures. 
2) Keep an eye out for discounted tickets.  the 2013-2014 season has been exceptional in regards to special offering for tickets.  This is probably because of their lack of real musical direction while they search for a new Music Director/Conductor.
Try the symphony's website or living social for deals.
3) Take a coat. It can be cold in the hall. If you're a guy, you should especially bring one for your girlfriend who will inevitably get cold and take it.",review,0,-2EuoueswhqEERWezJY8gw

It really doesn't get any more quaint than Bar Bianco, with their converted early-century brick house, hardwood floors, candlelit alcoves, and old-world porch.

Its great to see people just lounging without being in any sort of hurry to escape anywhere.  This is possibly the rarest sight in Arizona.  Moreover, there is a balance of young and old, spread throughout its interior foundations and its courtyard like a discharged honeybomb.  When you take a moment to realize the history behind the square, you sense that the mood probably hasn't changed very much in an entire century.  Being able to look to your acquaintances in closely neighboring restaurants and bars within Heritage Square gives a really cool sense of cultural and social community; this being the second rarest sight in Arizona.

Additionally, Bar Bianco makes it a habit to serve savory and rare-ish wines, my favorite being the locally produced Dos Cabezas Sangiovese.  The price of a bottle is pretty reasonable, although if you wait to order a bottle at The Restaurant, it is priced cheaper for some reason.  

Bar Bianco also used to serve Quilmes beer from Argentina, but apparently discontinued this practice.  

I've been here as both a subservient to Pizzeria Bianco, but also as a leisurely drinker respite from the binds of pizza, and I must say that its one of the most underrated drinking spots in the Valley.",review,3,-F32Vl8Rk4dwsmk0f2wRIw

I found the exhibit a true art form.  I watched the 5 minute video of how they preserve the bodies and what goes into the poses and am amazed.  I think the audio is a must for $5 more.   I learned a lot and would go back. Oh, that's right.... I am...for the Annual Yelp Party!

I have to say if I had children I would definitely take them to expose them to this amazing insight to our bodies.  A young Mom was there with a 4 year old & was explaining to her daughter what she was seeing, I have great admiration for parents that expose our youth to the arts and sciences, you go MOM!",review,2,ZC49A1K-if7KP8VJXoqELQ

It had been a while since my wife and I visited the Arizona Science Center, but we had to go when the Body Worlds and The Brain exhibit came to Phoenix.   Fascinating and amazingly preserved human bodies.  This is the first time my wife has encouraged me to look at naked women.  Honestly, if you have a chance to visit before the exhibit leaves town, go.  Soon.  Now would be good.  This special engagement will be gone after May 31, 2011.

There are a number of regular exhibits that are geared toward kids, many of them hands-on.  Several school bus loads of kids were there when we visited.   We did not spend much time near those areas.  You might try the late afternoon/evening, especially if you have your own young ones.  We returned again at a special event for adults only.  The ""kid"" zones can be entertaining for adults too.  Though, to a lesser degree.

The Dorrance Planetarium was oh, so cool.  Literally.  After rubbing shoulders with the mobs of people it was nice to just sit and ""chill"" in this well conditioned room.  I highly recommend the ""Black Holes"" presentation.  Unless....like my wife, you experience MoTiOn SiCkNeSs.  In which case it's a nice cool place to shut your eyes for a spell.  Though we did not see the Roller Coaster presentation I would expect that to have a similar effect.

We would bring the kids, and although they don't have a TON of stuff for little ones, it was a very happy medium for us fact-hungry parents. We had passes and would bring friends with us all the time who loved it.

We went again, just the two of us, for the Yelp event. And it was amazing. I loved the little hands on exhibit that they had, and the way they have the exhibits set up is just so perfect. We are now DYING to try out the bike ride, cable thing. And the planetarium is just... breathtaking. Loved it. The staff is always great, and they are so knowledgeable!

The one downside is that not only are they kinda pricey for the whole family, but then they charge for the extra exhibits on top of it. If me and my little family of 4 wanted to check out everything, it would easily cost us a hundred bucks. 

But even with that, the planetarium and staff pull my rating all the way up to 5 stars. You can see the prices online, and it's not geared to very small children.

Make sure you download the Groupon to your device before you enter the building, our AT&T coverage ceased to exist inside all the cement walls. No problem we walked back out the front and downloaded it. Get your parking validated too, it reduces the price from $12.00, to only $3.00. 

We got our Pirate tickets affixed our wristbands and took the elevator straight to the third floor exhibit. It all starts with a intro movie and a great entry into the actual exhibit. There were so many artifacts from the Whydah (whee-duh)!  My favorite was all the booty the pirates had plundered!  One liked the pistols, cannons, cannon shot and replica ship. The younger boys liked all the items they could touch and pick up!!  Our daughter loved the ship's bell and all the gold artifacts, especially the jewelry! The oldest of the kiddos liked the gift shop at the end of the exhibit. There were lots great pirate trinkets for all ages! I felt like a kid again, reading ""Treasure Island""!

The science center had other great exhibits on the other floors as well. The youngest boys liked the Monster Stomach!  If you've been to the science center you know why, if you haven't, you'll just have to make a visit and find out for yourself. 

The Freeman exhibit was also great!  Our kids enjoyed the pipes & valves, but had trouble putting them together. Not a plumber in the bunch! The adults tried to stack wooden blocks to create standing masterpieces, not an architect in our group either. 

Another draw was the SkyCycle!  A bicycle suspended above the first floor along a thick cable. Each adventurous ride will cost you $5.00 as a non-member, $3.00 for members. We enjoyed watching everyone ride across the sky. 

Everyone really enjoyed the MindBall challenge!  Two people put on the connectors and try to relax.  The person who relaxes most moves the ball till it reaches the other end. I was able to out relax them all, even with my two kids trying to distract me!

Each wall, of which there are many in this maze of an exhibit has video playing. This means that although there are people wandering through, you'll be able to glance left or right and see the video on another wall. Obviously, the more crowded the museum, the more difficult to see, but it only takes about 30 minutes for the video to complete it's cycle.  You can stay and see the parts you may have missed as it starts over on a continuous loop. 

On exit, you can buy a book and video. I don't recommend the video, it seems to have been shot while the exhibition was open to the public so you have people wandering through the DVD scenes as it's being filmed. It's not so much that they obscure the view, it's just simply too distracting.

Tip - If you are even thinking about coming back within a year (365 days), get an annual pass.

I'm so glad I waited to review this place until today (we went Friday, July 13th) because I remember my husband and I thinking  that, aside from the wonderful Body Works and Grossology temporary exhibits, some major improvements, additions and renovations were in order... And I was SO impressed with all the nice changes since we last visited with our kids (then age 3 and 7; now 6 and 10) a few years ago. 

ONE CAVEAT: If you live in the Phoenix Area, definitely opt for the membership, as just TWO VISITS make it worth the cost. (3 or 4 visits, which is completely reasonable just for the summertime will make the price even more attractive).
Another complaint I have is the check-in time for non-members (20 minutes on line just to step up to a cashier; all the while my kids had to endure the taunting view of the outdoor water/balls exhibit and I had to subsequently endure, ""Why is it taking so long?!"").

We circled the museum until we saw Heritage Parking (park there for the most convenience and price). Bring your ticket to the check-in counters inside the museum and they will validate your parking. Unfortunately, they will not cover 100% of the fee, but they will discount it. I believe we parked for 4 hours and I ended up paying $5. Heritage Parking also takes credit cards, so that really saved me a big headache.

We went on a day where there were huge crowds from school field trips, so it was hard to maneuver around, and super busy, but after the afternoon was over, much of it cleared out and we didn't have to wait in line to try out different exhibits. There were tons of interesting things to see and try out, Iuckily my 3 year old was interested, but I would not bring anyone younger than that, or else they will become bored.

It's unfortunate that the shows are to be paid individually and not included in admission, but I can understand. There was so much to see and do I was getting dizzy. I'm glad that they covered everything from physics, physiology, chemistry, geography, meteorology, technology, and much, much more.. it looks like they have a good range of subjects and it didn't look cheap.

I was able to get a membership (with my today admission counted in), for the 3 of us for $85, but it sucks that you have to pay for parking every. single. time.. too bad they don't just add full parking fees into the admission.

So that's what this entire edifice is all about. A shrine to scientific exploration. A Mecca of mechanical, natural and experimental marvels. But it's all broken down so the kiddos can appreciate. In my case, THIS kiddo can appreciate the digestible nuggets of information organized into pods of focus.

I can definitely recommend the Forces of Nature exhibit. It runs about every 15 mins, and takes you through tornadoes, forest fires, hurricanes, earthquakes and the extreme Arizona heat. It's all simulated with fans, water, shaking platforms, lights, and heat lamps. Pretty rad, and the kids will definitely want to do it a few times. I know I did.

Be sure to check out each floor. Take that elevator all the way up. If you're antsy, it's still going to take you a couple of hours to get around to everything. With more discovery in your bones, you're going to need the better part of an afternoon, or even close to a day. There's a cafe there, but I didn't get to try it and can't vouch for it.

As is the case with most museums or places like this, the exhibits come and go. Some are meant to be temporary, others will be around for years. So visit the website to see what you're in store for. You can upgrade your ticket if you're interested in some of the bonus features. When I was there there was some kind of sky-cycle-on-a-cable you could pay to ride.

Glad to share that this is sooooo not the case!  My son is 7 now and just this week, I've taken him twice to partake in Snow Week where for the past week, they've special activities planned for each day. 

The two days I was there, there were tons of special activities on the daily schedule and these special activities were so well planned, my son and his friend enjoyed participating in them so much that both days, we spent minimal time on their permanent exhibits!!!!

Whoever was in charge (maybe it was a team?) of Snow Week did an absolutely thumbs up (both thumbs up in fact) fanta-excellent job!  Both my son and his friend enjoyed the science experiments on the first floor theater, the making of mini bobsleds out of giant spuds (Idaho potatoes) then racing the, down mini sled tracks, mini ice hockey (ice frozen on cookie sheet then min ice hickey sticks made from Popsicle sticks and pucks made from penny covered with electrical tape)- genius. My son and his friend played for almost an hour with this simple contraption!

Scented balloons were a big hit, as was making the gingerbread house. 

Aside from the special activities, my favorite section (see, and I'm a grown up- I think) LOL. Big kid at heart, that's me- is on the 2nd level where the kids can hands on learn about mechanical properties. All of us (including me) can spend hours there going from one hands on exhibit to the next.

The bar: I enjoy the employees attitude, the new country with some top 40, cupid shuffle, some throwback songs, and fairly priced drinks in this decent sized dive bar. For smokers, there's a large back patio area. An ATM is available in the darts room. Parking is in front, the back, or at Food City. The Cash has supported charities, held drag shows, and threw themed nights, like the most recent black out party, and  they also host poker games, dance lessons, and of course, karaoke. For busy nights, they have 3 bar tenders serving, 2 in the front and 1 in the rear. 

The crowd: If you're visiting or new/ transplant, compared to flashy Los Angeles, hipster Seattle, and melting pot NYC's lez scene (to name a few cities), I've noticed that this place has lots of butch lesbians, about an even number of femmes, tomboys, androgynous, and a small handful of ultra femmes. For the most part everyone's friendly. You'll see a wide age range here, along with some straights, gay boys, etc. I've also noticed a trend.... the Cash's bathrooms are never nasty and are always stocked with TP and paper towels lol.

My wife knew about this metaphysical book store for years, but when we went to visit it, its original location had been all boarded up for some time.

I was impressed.  While I don't buy these kinds of books like I used to, some of the old used Manly P. Hall books (some of them signed) on the back wall were very tempting.

This just might be the best, most varied used book store I've found in the Valley so far.

They've got a decent amount of Crowley and the likes that many others won't even carry because it's not the pretty sparkly faerie dusty stuff.
The folks who run the place are always warm,genuine and inviting.
I even had a spooky kinda thing happen here.
It was 2 years ago in December.I stopped in between job interviews to find some candles for a friend.
They didn't have what I was looking for,but on my way out,a lady sitting at a reading table said,""before you go,come pick out a stone""from a bowl of shiny lil rocks.
I picked one I liked and she told me it would bring me something I needed.
I laughed to myself and said,""well,that would be a job""...(I'd been looking for a franticly stressed 2 months)and about 2 hours after I left the store,I got not one but 2 different offers.
I did call the store the next day to let her know what happened.

Super friendly service and tons of supplies you may need. The store is much bigger than the one that used to be on McDowell. Their specialty is Metaphysics, New Age, Paganism and the occult. We were greeted by Roz and Joy who were super friendly and answered all of our pestering questions. Roz even gave us some cold bottled water because it was so hot outside.

They had lots of different statues, but I came here interested if they had any Buddha statues, prayer flags, mala beads or books on the paranormal, which they had all of them! I pondered over some reiki infused scented candles that were only $2 and $15 handmade goblins. They also have a used section of books which is appreciated because sometimes this stuff can get really expensive. 

My partner specifically came here looking for tarot cards which they had in abundance. The ones he ended up liking they had to special order for him, which was nice. If you are looking for essential oils, herbs, kits, graveyard dirt, holy water, charcoal, sage, candles, they have all of that. They also offer readings and classes on things like rootwork, how to read the tarot, candle magick and crystal workshops.

All the food I had here was incredibly fresh, delicious, and flavorful.  It seems that everything is made in-house, including the tortillas, and it shows.  Prices are great too - I got two tacos and a burrito for about $12.  I also love the huge charcoal grill in the middle of this place, although it does fill the restaurant with smoke on occasion.

What I ate:

Lengua taco - super tender and fantastic.
Carne asada taco - extremely flavorful and just really awesome.
Chile relleno burrito - a MONSTER made of delicious.  The only reason I was able to eat this and two tacos is because I'm a fatass - I'm pretty sure a normal person couldn't even finish the lone burrito.

I also tried a bite of someone else's fish taco and it was awesome.  Most places deep-fry their fish for tacos, but La Tolteca grills it, which gives a different flavor and texture that is absolutely fantastic.

The salsas are also really fresh and delicious.  Even though I prefer spicier food, the mild salsa verde was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsa habanera had a good kick to it and satisfied my craving for something hot.

The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of ""best in Phoenix"" and they all left agreeing with me.

I confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more ""super"" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.

The carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!

The latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.

Before you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery).

When you see los chonchos eating here, you know it's good.

I always avoid Mexican restaurants because everyone does this slap together something that's so standard and has no flavor unless you get some standard bright red sauce. WELL NO MORE!!

My friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. 
When you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.

I had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalapeños (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with habañero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.

Sin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.

My friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (""ha-MAI-ca"") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! 

Water is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. 
Extra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. 
There's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.

Super Inside Skinny: That's freshly made molé in bags at the grocery counter.

Cool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. 
I usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!

So overall I'm sold and pleased with La Tolteca.

There salsa is great too! I love the guacamole and the extra hot salsa. The owner is so nice and you'll sometimes see her in the back preparing the food.

I've read a couple of the comments on the breakfast and I wouldn't recommend it. My brother didn't really like eggs but I don't think breakfast is what they specialize in. Overall It's delicious and I will be coming back for more!",review,0,Mnk17mWTJ0nrb49MakSIMw

Of course I had to rate it 5+ stars, it's been an excellent trip every time I've stopped by, and enjoyed some of the best Mexican food I've had.
La Tolteca, is an all in one stop for what you need food wise. They have a small grocery section, to where you can even get yourself a 40-quart tamale steamer, obviously you can use it for other uses as well. They sell masa, and anything else you would need to make your own dishes at home. 
They have an extensive bakery with fresh baked goods that they are continuously bringing fresh baked goods out. They make cakes, flan, tres leches, and many other delicious desserts, and can customize an order for you and make you anything you'd like. They even have samples available, and of course I'm one of those guys who goes hog wild on samples :)
They have a meat section too, to where you can get 1/4-whole chickens, ribs, and other meats. They make fresh guacamole, queso fresco, and many other delights.
Their food selection is huge, and it would take me awhile just to try everything from the 5lb super torta, he super burrito, soups, breakfast items, and many other foods.
They even cater!
Today I had my usual, three mini cabeza tacos, refried beans, and horchata.
Their cabeza is the best I've had. It's juicy, crisp, flavorful, and not greasy in one bit unlike most places that make cabeza.
The beans were delicious and moist. They weren't dried out of pasty like you may find at some quick stop Mexican restaurants or chains.
Horchata is great no matter where you go.
Prices are inexpensive no matter what you get, and for someone on a budget like myself, it's a great deal. You can fill yourself up on food and not break the bank.
I highly recommend stopping here and trying something new, it's not some Taco Bell so don't come in here expecting some Americanized garbage. This is the real deal.
I know for one, I will be back, maybe to try something new, or to have some more delicious cabeza.",review,1,bm27BTjCnBYGZiFstNMFLA

First of all everything is made in house. Try the Fish Tacos, they are off the hook amazing and so inexpensive that they blow my mind. Grilled Mahi Mahi, fresh corn tortillias, crema, cabbage, cotija cheese. A winner.

The Tacos de Papa are addictive. 

The Ceviche Tostada is something that I dream about. 

If you are into burrito's check this place out, awesome big rolls of home cooking. 

The Carne Asada is delicious and so is the roasted chicken. OH MY GOD. 

Try the Elotes, all the grilling is over mesquite charcoal imported from Mexico. This is where I fell in love with grilled corn. You will thank me.

The outdoor seating area looks quite enjoyable for a late night snack, though I'm not sure if they are open that late.  Gotta love the outdoor ordering window.  You're best best inside is if you can catch a seat at the corner of the counter.  You not only get a great view of the chef doing the cooking but have a nice fat fan behind you to cool you off.  

We arrived shortly after it opened and chatted with the cook to get his suggestions on what to order.  Very friendly and funny.  The counter's got various coffee table books full of quotes and handy worst case scenario answers.  

I had the Garfield which was a fried egg sandwich specialty.  I can't really recall all the ingredients but the salsa in the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was knock out.  Prepared with olive oil, it was by far one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had.  The french fries were done just right and the seasoning on them really hit the spot.  The total for both of us including a couple of ice teas was under twenty dollars.  A great deal anywhere.

Just a friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY!  I had to run to a couple of nearby gas station ATMs since the first was out of order.

Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.

The neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are ""rustic"", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!

You can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!

We started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.

The porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). 

All in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style.

THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE

When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place.

We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.

(PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)

Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.

The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.

THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS
We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.

MOZZARELLA
The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.

GNOCCHI
If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.  

LEMON CURD
We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.

$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.

I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, 
June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

Thank you Marshall Shore for letting us know about this place!  We were a party of nine for Easter dinner last night - we filled the diner itself and ordered 1 of everything on the menu [2 of certain items].  There were 10 dinner items and 4 dessert items.  We passed the dishes down the counter to each other.

The menu is strictly vegetarian, but Payton keeps a few meat items available for hard core meaties - like my daughter and I who shared a heavenly fettuccine bolognese.

Each dish was superb.  I have a really hard time deciding on a favorite, but I think I'll go with the Fava and Steuben beans served in agave nectar with a walnut pesto.  My wife and daughter are going with the Beluga lentils, parsley and celery leaf.

We had a tasting menu [no pairing] I would have been happy to pay $75 for and we got away with $20.

Also having been a fan of Digestif and Caffe Boa, during Patyon's residency, this is his best work, yet. I am floored by Payton's creativity and fresh-style every time I'm at the Welcome Diner.

I haven't had anything yet that left me wanting more. Each dish is well thought out and perfectly executed. Payton manages to capture the purity and freshness of the ingredients that so many chefs in town manage to murder. 

As excited as I am to have Payton around the corner from my house, I am even more excited and anxious to see what his next spot will deliver. It's only going up from here folks and if your not on the Curry train yet, get on. 

If you're one of those people who enjoys bland food and thinks that every restaurant needs a nice view, please stay out of our neighborhood and stop yelping about how Noca is in a strip mall.

The service at this place cannot be beat.  When you are seated outside, every member of the team will be by to inquire about your experience and see if there's anything more they can do.  When you're seated inside, you are a part of the whole Welcome Diner experience.

I most recently had the smothered pork plate, which was pulled pork with a beer and onion gravy over a bed of jasmine rice, with sides of delicious collard greens and house-made poblano hush puppies.  It was a heaping plate of food for $11.50.  The next night, we returned, at my niece's request, and I had the Port of Call burger.  It was yummy beefy goodness with perfect fries on the side.

So, it's going to take me a while to sample everything the Welcome Diner has to offer, but I go at least weekly and I am dedicated to sampling all the goodness they have to offer.  This place is a gem.  Don't tell anybody.

The food here is the star, but the workers and cooks are all having a great time, really genuine and fun, and overall make the experience even better. 

The Port of Call burger is exactly what you want: perfectly cooked, coated in cheese and onions and whatever else, and the type of meal that will leave you just barely too full.

The fried chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, if you can unhinge your jaw to take it on. Get it with melted cheese, and go even further by tacking on gravy and bacon, if you think your heart can handle it.

The fries are fantastic as well. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of ingredients loads the food with flavor and makes it well worth it. They also have some amazing specials, and: their biscuits.

Outside of the Five & Diner franchise, I hadn't been to anything resembling an authentic diner in the Phoenix area.  Ever.  So what a surprise to find an old diner transplanted from back east into the downtown Phoenix area.  It's a little on the fringes as the immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we were going for a late breakfast on a Saturday so I didn't worry too much about my car.

The diner itself truly is a timewarp.  The interior is a simple 9 stool diner with a cooking area just as tiny.  You can't help but converse with the waitress and the cooking staff since they're basically right in front of your face.  If you're looking for more room (and want to keep an eye on your ride), there's picnic tables with umbrellas outside.

We got here around 11am so my girlfriend and I didn't feel too self conscious ordering drinks.  I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.

We so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.

I used to drive all over the valley depending on what mood I was in, and now I pretty much just go to the Welcome Diner. They have about 9 seats inside and quite a bit of patio seating. They have a few nice big outdoor heaters too.

Some things I love

-Excellent quality food sourced from local vendors
-Amazing amazing drinks. They make their own bitters, grenadine, squeeze their own lime juice  and even have fresh herbs to put in. Each one I've seen made is with love.
-Good service, fun atmosphere
-Almost everything is made from scratch
-Specials that are (always delicious) experiments, not leftovers.
-Catfish Fridays (Try the sampler!)


I would say price wise it's not necessarily cheap, but not expensive. Average plate will run you about $10, but considering the quality and atmosphere I have no problem paying it! 

Favorite dishes-
PB&B burger
Bacon Blue burger
Veggie Stallion (housemade edamame and mushroom veggie burger with housemade ricotta)
Red beans and rice with sausage
Grilled cheese on a housemade biscuit.

It is becoming quite the neighborhood favorite and I think it's because they just do it right. The setting is so...welcoming.

The food has clever names like ""Holy Puerco and Captain Fantasy"") oh and it is freaking amazing. Even the menu's artwork looks awesome (done by a local artist/cartoonist.)

I've been here three weekends in a row. The first time I had the Captain Fantasy which was endlessly delicious. Barbecued chicken on a fresh homemade biscuit with bacon, cheese and greens. I also had fries, wow a lot of food! The other two times I've had the Sunrise Sandwich with sausage and an egg over easy. It is also placed between a tasty biscuit along with some arugula. Yum! My boyfriend has had the welcome breakfast with chorizo and the Little Birdy. I had bites! I also tried their fried avocado, genius.

They serve drinks. Apparently on Tuesdays they have Hurricane Tuesdays, $5 for their famous hurricanes. I've also heard their Bloody Mary's are brilliant.

The kitchen is very small. This vintage diner car was meant for one cook. So the two guys in there really have to hustle and work around each other. The food is top quality as well. My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face. I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork. 

The best part of Welcome Diner is the atmosphere: twinkling lights, picnic style seating, and friendly staff. I'm not sure who was working this last Saturday night, but he was so friendly and knowledgeable. We had a good little conversation about the history of the diner car.

It's hard to tell which stands out the most, their amazing food preparations or their welcoming staff. 

1st patronage: we were able to sit inside the tiny trailer and the guys who were working that day were awesome. Great customer service, made us feel known and welcomed! That day I enjoyed the Welcome Burger with no regrets! Husband got the Big Jim & was very satisfied! 

2nd patronage: I popped by for an iced coffee (they serve Lux brew) , and the gal working (can't remember her name now, but she's got blue hair ;) was super friendly! She even hooked me up with a refill for the price of free, I was like wow, these folks are nice :)

3rd patronage: we weren't feeling meat, so we tried the Vegan Po' Boy...was surprised at what a delicious sandwich it was, nothing poor about it! 

Their fries are the best around. Their coleslaw is distinct. Their service is appreciated. I'm looking forward to enjoying more meals here. 

I'm busy and really don't have time to write reviews, but I'll type one up for a local business I want to support! They also use all local AZ grown ingredients folks.

My friend got a collard green sandwich with a fried egg on top. She smashed it and then raved about how great it was. Each sandwich came with a side of fruit which was the perfect side for the heavy sandwiches.

The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but not so much during the day. Since you're sitting outside, it's allowed for some pretty entertaining people watching.

The brunch here is awesome! I always get super excited when I can have biscuits and gravy (since the only animal I eat is of the fish variety). You can get biscuits with mushroom gravy!! The portion I got was huge and so dang tasty.

I was a little unsure if I was headed to the right place, since Welcome Diner is located in a neighborhood, but I'm so glad that I found it.  My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.

I got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.

After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.",review,0,UMq89piQvpAVFVfiGc6ndA

Best Horchata in Phoenix (you have to get it early though because they keep it cold with ice so by late in the day it is slightly watered down and the ideal heterogeneous concentration is lost). The food court inside is amazing. I have been there more times than you and have never had a problem with any of the food or staff. Sometimes communication can be difficult when ordering but if you know exactly what you want (like me) or unless you are fluent in Spanish (which I am not) there should be no problem, so no lallygagging around and no special orders. 

The constant excitement added with a little bit of the English vs. Spanish war gives you the warmth and feel of a truly authentic Phoenix super market food court (I am sure there is some special name for it in the Hispanic culture, or at least something that sounds cooler than food court). I am fortunate that within my lifetime to have lived within a 5 minute drive of the Ranch Market, and I miss it dearly.

I know there are a lot of grocery stores called ""Ranch Market"" throughout the Valley, but when you live anywhere near this one it is the ONLY Ranch Market you will acknowledge. Go there, get a 1/2 pound of carnitas from the cooked meat section, it comes with corn tortillas and some green salsa/sauce/concoction that goes with it great. Don't forget the beans and rice. Salsa bar is on the left on the way out.

I knew I was in for a treat just after getting out of the car - mexican party music piped into the parking lot & super bright displays visible through the doors. My boyfriend & I went up and down every aisle grabbing fun products to make awesome meals at home - masa, cast iron tortilla press, various mexican cheeses like asadero & oaxaca, fresh chips, fresh butter tortillas, real sugar pepsi & coke bottles, dried chillies, dried herbs (mexican oregano & cinnamon), nectars & coconut water to use as margarita mixers, etc. There is an entire cheese deli devoted to various kinds of cotija cheese (there had to be at least 10 different kinds). You can buy every kind of fresh tortilla your mind can think of, even whole wheat. There is a fresh fruit & salsa bar where you can buy stuff priced insanely low by the pound ($1.50/pound of fresh fruit?unreal!).

When you visit, pick up a catalog at the front desk, and leave your purse if you have one.  (You can't bring bags to the back.)  Many of the items on the shelves have prices written on the cartons, but some don't.  And, remember, this is a warehouse...the employees are filling internet orders.  They are not there to tell you prices.  But, trust me, you won't find lower prices anywhere except maybe a yard sale or second hand store.

If you live in AZ but not close to Ryan's, a handy thing to know is that you can order on their website an select ""pick up"".  Then, your order is already pulled for you when you arrive, and you just need to pay for it.

Of course, you can always order online and have it shipped to you.

They do have a minimum purchase requirement of $20 or $25, because they are not a retail store but an internet warehouse.  Really not a big deal...you will not believe how much you can get for your money!",review,2,UvBNAcvY4fOgABukFCEDXg

The drive is definitely worth it, and what's best is that you can place pick up orders (which will be ready within 3 hours of you placing the order) and there is no additional cost for that, which is great if you are short on time or can only make it in before they close but don't have enough time to walk through the warehouse.

Whether you are into the perfectly fluffy raised and glazed or the old school cake donuts, you will not be disappointed. 

Croissants and other pastries are also fantastic and deserve a try. 

But the real masterpiece at Rainbow is their enormous (and standard priced) Buttermilk donut. It will fill you up like eating three regular donuts as I'm pretty sure they use a yeast based dough to make this little gift-from-donut-heaven.

I was being seen every 2 weeks for 7 months and have found the office staff courteous, the ultrasonographers top notch (they knew the sex of the twins at week 12!) and the physicians knowledgeable and warm.  It is true that the wait times can be long especially in the afternoon but this is a fact of life in a high risk practice where many of the patients are very complicated.  To minimize this issue i would ask for the first available morning appointments if you can work this into your schedule.  To me, modifying my schedule seemed insignificant compared with the outstanding care i and my twins were receiving.  

A primary issue id like to address is the continuity of care.  This is a large practice with 10+ doctors and it is true that at time the doctor was not overly familiar with my case since the doctors do rotate among 3 valley locations.  We had no significant complications so this was not that big of an issue for us but i can see how that would be difficult for someone who had a serious ongoing medical complication and/or did not feel comfortable with the details of their own medical care.  PPA is a very large group practice with many moving parts and lack of continuity is a major weakness of large group practices as a model.  If you are not comfortable with this type of model dont go to PPA.  There are other, smaller, MFM practices out there that can give you the personal touch you desire.   I work in the medical field and felt comfortable relaying the details of my case to the physician i was seeing.  They do have your chart with them they just may not have reviewed it in detail before the appointment.  Any time i did have a question either generally speaking with multiple gestation or specific to my case they were able to answer the questions to my satisfaction.

Other perks of this practice is that at Banner Good Sam and at Scottsdale Shea (i think) they have 24 hour in house coverage. I landed in OB Triage at Good Sam at 32 weeks with concern for preterm labor and the PPA physician on call came and spoke to me personally and relayed the information to the office for my office visit the next day.  I was impressed and relieved by this type of physician coverage. When i give birth in the next few weeks it will be nice to know that there is already a doctor on call on the premises.

In short, PPA is an excellent choice for high risk pregnancy care if you are wiling to modify your schedule to show up in the morning to avoid wait times and if you are okay with some lack of continuity of care that in my opinion does not affect the quality of care which is outstanding.",review,0,8htMWt7OikU-3rAYK9bhkQ

I have worked downtown for over 5 years and drove by this place every day twice a day.... and had no idea it was even open for business. The place looks abandoned and quite scary.  I have seen some interesting people next door and I would have never given the place a shot if it wasn't for you all!    On to the food :) 

Since this was my first time I thought I would try the basic Mexican food combo to judge the place.  I had the #17 Taco and Enchilada rice and beans I added beef to the enchilada. (comes shredded unless you specify ground) I can't say one bad thing about the dish. It was amazing. The rice was perfect for my taste and even the beans were good.  I really enjoyed the salsa. Some may not since it is not a fresh tomato and onion type of salsa. It is more like a hot sauce. The service was good. The atmosphere was good.  Prices are good.

I was downtown so I decided to check it out with my sister.... I ordered the #5 carne asada soft tacos off the lunch menu and a large horchata ($5.99 and $1.99) and my sister order just one chicken soft taco............probably because I brought her to a place she's never been before, plus there were a few guys outside working on a vehicle and it sat in an open lot between two odd buildings... haha. So we got our food within 8 mins, not bad at all... she opened her bag and took one bite then scarffed the rest. I gave her a look as I was opening my food, as if to say your not touching mine because I had enough faith to order alot and i'm going to eat it all look.... It came with very delicious pico de gallo and red and green salsa. All three combined in my taco was awesome:).... full of flavor! The tacos came with rice and beans, both cooked perfectly... We didnt dine-in so i can't comment much about the service, but cashier lady was helpful and nice.

I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans.

I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.

What can be better than brunch/lunch in a quaint historic home adorned with kitschy antiques? Nothing! The answer is nothing.

We went here for a late lunch one Saturday, and it hit the spot. It was perfect. We all fell in love with the adorable house and its wooden floors, unique furniture and abundance of natural daylight. Our server was quite friendly and pleasant, and she let us take our time while also suggesting menu options.

We started with 3 sticky buns - a little rich for me, but very indulgent and sinful. Yum. My husband then moved on to a cheeseburger, which was very tasty. My friend ordered the turkey sandwich, which was bigger than big. I ordered a cup of soup and a half chicken salad sandwich. All of it was very satisfying and super filling. Of course, we couldn't pass on dessert, so we tried the bread pudding. Simply fabulous.

I am dying to go back for brunch...I'd love to try an omelet and mimosa here. I've heard the wait is bad, but we were seated immediately at 1:30pm on a Saturday. After living among the land of the strip mall in North Scottsdale, Coronado Cafe was a much needed and welcome change!

My first encounter a few months ago was on a whim. I was slightly hungry and just wanted something quick and healthy before I headed off to do my next massage. Well hello Coronado Cafe. I had been wanting to try this place but just kept passing it by. It is late afternoon and I walk up to the door and it is locked. Ohh well I thought I guess they close after lunch then reopen for dinner. I start to walk away and someone opens the door. The guy explains that they are indeed closed until dinner and would open in about 30 mins or so. Well I could not wait that long or I would be late for my next appointment. He says come on in anyway. What customer service! I just had a quick salad and it was wonderful. I really appreciated the guy doing that for me. 

HINT TO RESTAURANT OWNERS: Customer service is key. 

So I went back a few days later for brunch and had the friendliest waiter...Dan. He is great. I go in pretty regularly on Saturdays for brunch and for a great meal and a little chatting with Dan.

OK back to the food. My brunch consisted of the Crab Eggs Benedict, with a side of roasted potatoes and fruit salad. This is one of my FAVORITE meals ever. They get it right with the texture (big thing for me) and the flavors. They use foccacia bread instead of English muffins. The crab is lump crab meat with a few slices of avocado on top. The hollandaise sauce is creamy and light. Not too heavy. Sometimes this sauce can be made that weighs the dish down. Now I am personally taking a chance on eating eggs over easy but it is so good. I try to be aware of it but sometimes the eggs win and my tummy pays for it later :(

The Farm Salad is awesome. Salty, tangy goat cheese warm and gooey coated with nuts. The strawberries add a little sweetness. YUM YUM

The Portebello sandwich is another favorite. So you vegetarians won't be disappointed here. 

I will say they charge $3 for iced tea. Now that is a bit much especially when you are using crappy Lipton tea. I am a tea lover and don't mind spending that kind of money on tea but it better be fresh tea leaves that I can get a few presses out of.

It is a small place so you will be in close proximity to other patrons. However, I have ended up in a few nice conversations with some very nice individuals. I sometimes come early for brunch and have a whole room to myself to eat, read and chat with my waiter extraordinaire Dan.

Lunch is usually packed here and the wait can be long so keep that in mind and try to go when you can have an executive lunch.

All in all I love CC. It is becoming the equivalent of my neighborhood diner. (All you NY'ers know what I am talking about) The place where you come in and everyone knows you and you have great meal with some great company.

We agreed that we wanted to share a few small dishes.  The crab cakes and scallops proved to be a super tasty start.  We highly recommend both!

Each of us ordered a Greek salad.  It was a little too tart for me, but Jeannie enjoyed hers and helped me with mine.

Finished off our shared meal with the special of the day.  It was halibut with a parsnip puree and steamed veggies.  The fish tasted very fresh and the parsnip puree was enjoyed more by me than the lovely wife.

Just finished a brunch at Coronado cafe...  I had the southwestern omelette, and my fiancé had the crab cakes.  First of all the $3 bloody Mary's and mimosas are a steal, but that became an after note to the food!  The crab cakes are out of this world, huge chunks of meat and before I could ask for a second bite it was gone.  Luckily I had my own omelette that did not disappoint.  Cheesy, hatch chilies and really tasty potatoes on the side.  The service was good, and the owner was available and really matches the curbside appeal.  Great ambiance in a cool historic house.

We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:

Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.

Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small
in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.

Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.

recommended Food:
Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.
Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.
Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.
Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.
Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.
Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.


Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it.",review,0,9g_ARKx0eJmNH8oO1TR9rQ

My party of two got some beer, local and microbrew style. We had lots of fun looking over the martini menu, which was extensive, creative, and kind of grossed us out in certain situations, but in a good fun way. The friendly waitress came to us while we were nursing our beers to apologize for the delay of food, which my bf and I hadn't noticed. Anyways, the delay was because the cooks had to make us new, fresh beef patties. No complaints there!

We walked over to this place from the Heard Museum. My trusty Android phone GPS guided us through two wonderful historic neighborhoods to get there, and it turned out to be a straight shot down the street.
Thanks Google Maps. Ah well. We needed the exercise.
Anyway, quaint, eclectic decor, very personable server with whom we found out we are neighbors and may soon be friends.
They were tolerant of our energetic two year old daughter, so though the place wasn't specifically ""kid friendly,"" they were welcoming and didn't mind when she moved all the sweetener packets to the neighboring table, sucked lemons and threw the rinds on the floor, or did the usual range of energetic two year old antics.
The sign out front said they had ""The Best Crab Cakes in Phoenix.""
Now, I'm not a huge seafood fan. I'm from Ohio - the only crabs there are... well. Never mind. That would be a joke in poor taste.
My Malaysian wife, however, is a seafood Ninja Jedi Master. There are restaurants in her home town where the fishing boats literally pull up alongside the restaurant with the day's catch.
She ate these crab cakes, and declared them to be delicious. She is now intent on trying every other crab cake in the Phoenix metro area in order to make an accurate comparison - but we will come back to Coronado Cafe.
My Mom and I both loved them, and will come back with my Dad, who is a crab cake aficionado.
My advice is, order the crab cake entree. They really pull out all the stops for that one. My wife and mom ordered the open faced sandwich, and then wished they'd ordered the entree. They were jealous of me, which is ideal.
The hummus makes a great appetizer.
We'll be back, and soon, and maybe we'll leave the little one with a sitter next time!

This was our second trip here - the first time was purely by chance during a trip to the Heard Museum, which is a short and beautiful walk through a historical district away.
The first time It immediately became a favorite, and added to the list of go-to places for taking out of town guests to dinner.
This was the promised ""bring Dad"" trip from the *previous* review, and they didn't disappoint. Dad arrived before us, and had a good conversation with the owner. He knew more about the place than we did by the time we got there. That's my Dad.
When they say ""Best Crab Cakes in Phoenix,"" they mean it. We stuffed ourselves on them. These are not a few chunks of crab surrounded by a loaf of breading. These are big, chunky, fresh crab.
For my wife, who is from a seaside village in Penang, Malaysia, the good seafood dishes are a joy you can see on her face while she's enjoying them.

We had to say good bye to family at the airport, and so wanted a decadent distraction to followup the sadness.  Fancy phosphates and floats served us nicely!
You know how classic diners and decor are trendy now, and places are trying to make their restaurants look like they came through a time machine?  Well, this place is the real deal--an authentic 1920's soda shop, now surrounded by a vintage shop (it used to be a drug store).  The place is just wonderful to walk into.  
Our waitress was unbelievably friendly.  You could tell that the 50's look for her was not just an act--it was her life.  Not only was she friendly, but fast as well.  From the menu, I tried a kiwi phosphate, a tiger's blood (cherry/coconut) Italian soda, tuna sandwich on sourdough, Navy bean soup, and a float to top it off.  All was delicious.  The tuna was not flooded in mayo and was the fattest tuna sandwich I've ever had.  The cole slaw on the side was also a bit dry (little mayo), which to me, is a wonderful thing.  A little pineapple acted to enhance the flavor further.  I am persnickety about slaw, but this I liked.  The drinks were deliciously fizzy.  For desert, we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake bunt cake.  Moments later, the waitress came back to tell us that sadly, she did not have a piece big enough to sell to us, but that there was a small piece left that she could simply give to us for free.  We agreed and added a float for good measure.  The float was pistachio ice cream and amaretto soda.  Unbelievable!  Hands down the best float I've ever had.  And I love that the spoons come in a shot glass of even more soda.  That way, when you eat some of the ice cream, you can add more soda.  Brilliant!  Oh, and the free piece of bunt cake?  It turned out to be the size of a normal piece of cake, but for free.  And it too was delicious.
The stores that flank the restaurant served as a good distraction while walking off a few of the hundreds and hundreds of calories consumed.  
The only real problem was coming down from the sugar high about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson.  
I will be back.  And next time, I'm going to be crazy and try the ""dill pickle"" phosphate.",review,0,mtfkAgyunxat9fcCvDLVRw

What many patrons do not know is that the owners purchased this business shortly before 9/11 and were advised by friends to unload it because it did not have potential for an ROI.

They ignored the advice, poured their heart and soul into it, and are a huge reason why there are 83 reviews sitting here for your perusal.  Their fortitude is a gift for which Phoenix should be grateful.

These guys absolutely knocked themselves out for our event!  And it didn't matter that it was August and the A/C was not made to accommodate the crowd we brought in.  People stayed, ate, shopped the vintage store, and had a great time.

Carolina's came close. Juan's fell decidedly short. A few other run down shacks that we've tried have always been inconsistant or disappointing...

One slow mid-morning at work we were trying to figure out a good fast place to get takeout and bring back to the office. Someone mentioned Ritos. Someone mentioned that they have the best bean and cheese burrito. My ears perked up. Upon arriving I noticed that they actually have a bean, rice and cheese burrito on the menu, something that most places have never heard of.

The burrito itself was HUGE. The salsa can be purchased in a large enough container that the whole burrito can be dipped in (don't laugh, this is an important aspect) and provides enough flavor and kick to compliment the beany goodness inside.

8982,Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA,0,2009-03-01,0,nhEcH8WePPP4p0rhzLW5YA,5,"Four words make me salivate:  Rito's.  Green.  Chili.  Burro.  I am actually salivating as I write this on a full stomach.  It's damn the diet kind of food because this is one of life's great pleasures.

The most important thing about Rito's green chili burro is avoiding a blowout.  A blowout is defined as recklessly biting into the burro and putting too much pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.  This creates a hole in the tortilla and the stew drips all over you.  Not only do you lose out on the greatness of the broth, but you have a mess on your hands.  Avoid a blowout at all costs.

The best method I have found is to massage the burro from the bottom up so as to get some of the liquid to the top of the tortilla.  Then when you start taking your first few bites, suck in when you bite.  This ensures you get plenty of liquid with each bite and you sufficiently reduce the pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.

If the unfortunate occurs and you do experience a blowout, the best course of action is to remember the three second rule and quickly lick up all the broth on your hands, fingers, and table.  Sometimes it happens to the best of us so don't be too hard on yourself.",review,0,NiznCY3sXPh-nkQjoTPFrQ

The burrito was large and a bit spicy, very good.  I can't recommend it enough.  There were a few minor negatives.  Service is a bit slow, no fountain soda and menu options are limited to burritos, chimis and a couple of tostadas, but as long as you know this going in you will be very happy.  Bottom line = Great food at reasonable prices.  

They were also serving Tacos when I was there 8/3/09.  I've noticed some reviews say they stopped serving them, but they must on occasion.  They are not back on the menu, but they had a cardboard sign at the counter stating that they were for sale that day.

I'd just never passed by it or knew where it was so I always forgot to seek it out.  But I am kookoo for cocoa puffs about green chile and had heard this place had the best in town.  One day recently, I was driving around the Garfield district looking for a possible new pad as I want to live downtown.  I was driving up and down each block looking at rentals that weren't totally sketchy.  It's and up and coming area, but it's still a pretty rough neighborhood.  As I was driving down 14th st. past a grade school, I spotted people standing in a short line out the door of a converted house with picnic tables outside.  A light bulb went on in my head.  Aaaah, this must be that place they talk about in the magazines and papers.  Rito's!  It was 11:30, so I parked, which would probably have been difficult if I'd gotten there 15 mins later.  The menu is just burritos and tacos and beans pretty much.  There are plaques all over Rito's walls from year after year proclaiming it to be the burrito king of Phoenix.  I got a green burro and a side of beans, waited about 5 mins for my order and went out to a picnic table to dine in the sun.  I shared a table with some other folks and a pigeon.  They are not big on ambiance here.  What they lack in that, they make up for in pure, unadulterated burrito kick-assery.  The beans, hot as molten lava and a bit soupy, were the most flavorful frijoles I have ever, EVER tasted.   The hot sauce, heavy on the oregano, was lovely with good heat for me. The tortilla was thin and chewy with just the right bits of char kissing it.  The green chile filling, again a bit more soupy than I'm used to,  was just sublime.  I couldn't have eaten it without a knife and fork though, cuz it would have oozed all down the front of me.  Make sure you ask them for a knife and fork; they don't just put it in the bag.  They do take debit cards now, I guess it used to be a cash only business.  Boy, am I glad I just happened upon this mythical burrito abode!

I'm not much of a pork fan, (excluding bacon of course) which is usually what is in the burritos, so I usually just order a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Green is the only way to go in my opinion. The burritos are huge, and are filled with so much beans, cheese, and green enchilada sauce, it's overflowing as soon as you take the first bite. It's always hot because they make each order fresh, but be prepared to wait especially if you go between 11-1. I try to only go after 1, but it's not uncommon to wait 20 minutes even going after the lunch rush. So if you have only an hour lunch, and you work downtown, you better be a speedy driver. I usually only have about ten minutes to eat after driving over and waiting in line, so that's definitely something to take into consideration.

It's a little hard to find at first because there isn't a sign, and the business operates out of an old house across from a school, but you'll know you're in the right place when you see the line up of cars for a block. The staff is all very friendly, but there isn't a lot of waiting room inside, and there really isn't too much space outside to eat either, so it's more of a grab and go kind of restaurant, which I don't mind because I probably would not choose to stay and eat there either, but you're going there for the food not the experience.

The only other downside aside from the wait, and the lack of seating and cleanness, are that the green burritos are twice as much as the red ones because they are so popular. I personally think that this is ridiculous, but obviously everyone is still willing to pay for it. All in all it's a great little hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix, and a must try if you are craving some delicious green chile.",review,1,ptKhErQ7j0_RgqRh0j0UvQ

Their question ""are you serving beer?"", and yes I was! The next question ""you like spicy?"" and yes i do.  She went over to the side wall and pulled two giant red links off the rack and said with a smile ""This...will be good."" (when I got home I tried a little and It was good!)

I can see where people can say the ladies behind the counter are intimidating but they really are wonderful.  I have stopped in for a sandwich a time or two in the afternoon and had great conversations with them when I was the only one in the store and it was slow.  They have even offered me a tour once.

This is a place ran by hard working immigrants that have an amazing product. Every time I am in the area a make a point of stopping in and getting the smoked butt (the ""butt"" is actually the shoulder cut on a pig bot the actual butt). Its excellent sliced thin on a sandwich.

This was the first place we tried.  After 13 places, we stopped trying anything else.  This is literally the gold standard.

Not to say there isn't amazing ceviche in other places, or even great ceviches at trendier spots.  This is just what all ceviche needs to start its life as: shrimp, cucumbers, onions and tomato.  Slice of avacado on top, ample selection of hot sauces if you so desire.  (He does, I don't.)    

If you want to add or create away from that basic recipe.  So be it.  It's been done nicely at loads of expensive trendy spots. (Scottsdale: Seriously, $10 for a tostada?) But if you do it this good, why in the world would you mess with it?

Back to MPH:  The tomatillo-avacado salsa is one of the biggest reasons I can never leave Phoenix.  I would literally crinkle up and die if I didn't get it once a week.

Just go.   It's seafood, so the regular menu is not ""cheap mexican."" 
BUT, nine times out of ten, I just go in for a beer, a ceviche tostada.  If we go during happy hour, two beers, two ceviche tostadas and chips and salsa will set me and the boy back $12.  During scorching summers, who wants any more food than that?  When it's 115 outside, getting a lovely, air conditioned place to sit, drink a beer, eat great food....and leave for under $20 for two people makes this a true find.

The outside actually isn't THAT bad, but yes, I would hesitate to go in if it weren't for all the fantastic reviews on yelp.  Once inside, it is just as all the pretty yelp pictures depict: a clean and bright dining room with colorful tables and chairs.  My friend and I ordered the mixed seafood cocktail and the shrimp culichi.  Both were super tasty, as were the complimentary ceviche tostadas.  The culichi sauce was so good that I had to stop myself from drinking it.  The seafood cocktail was very refreshing - just what is needed during the Phoenix summer.  It had shrimp, oysters, clams, abalone, calamari, and octopus.  Almost all the seafood was fresh and sweet, and the dish was huge.  The only critique is I can do without the clams.  They are the tiny canned ones instead of the fresh ones like I had in the cocktails in Mexico.  Service was really good as well.  Overall, this was a very pleasant experience.

There were so many wonderful things to try on the menu that we all ordered something different. After we ordered we were given some of the best cevichi I have ever as an appetizer (no charge)! 
Even though the kitchen had to prepare 12 different plates, they all came out together. 
EVERYTHING was very carefully made and delicious. By far some of the finest Mexican food in the valley. We travel in Mexico often and have had many wonderful meals there. Imagine going to 16th street and Roosevelt for something even better.

Everything was just about right.

The service was prompt and helpful.
The salad was fresh and crispy.
The rice was filled with little chunks of green beans and carrots and I think corn too.
The refried beans were not overly fatty nor were they overly salty.
The guacamole was chunky and tasty, with BIG chunks of avocado.
The corn tortillas were light, soft, and fresh.
The Shrimp culichi sauce was so good that I was eating it with a spoon.
The Negra Modelo on tap in a 28-oz glass for $3 was a super-bargain and Oh So Cold and Yummy.
The chips were hot and fairly thick and a little oily - top notch.
The red salsa was smokey and had a bit of kick.
The green tomatillo/avocado salsa was about the best I've had in town.
OH YES I ALMOST FORGOT:  They gave me an ""on the house"" Ceviche tostada, and it was the BEST Ceviche I have EVER tasted.  I don't normally like it, but this was SCRUMPTIOUS.

Can't wait for tomorrow to munch on the leftovers.

I sliced some of the fish and put it in a freshly made flour tortilla and spooned some of the Green sauce on it and was in heaven. I ordered the fried (breaded) Fish & Shrimp. The shrimp needed no sauce at all. The breading was perfectly seasoned and the shrimp were some of the largest and tastiest I have had. There was way to much food for even a hearty eater. Don't let the location scare you it is perfectly safe and the place is warm and inviting inside. My only regret is I was to full to eat some of the yummy looking deserts in the case.

My 5 year old nephew is a VERY picky eater. I don't think he's ever tried seafood and liked it, but I somehow got him (okay forced him) to have camarones a la plancha once. Whabam!

Once you get pasted the secretive tinted windows, however, it's an entirely different world. Vibrant colors hit your eyes and vivacious music pleases your eardrums. It really makes you feel like you're near a playa hermosa. 

To start off, we were given a complimentary hard tortilla with ceviche on it. You can taste how fresh and delectable the combination of ingredients is. I've had plenty of ceviche in Latin American countries and theirs is on par. 

The selection here is ridiculous, but in a good way. I ended up going simple and ordering some shrimp tacos. You get 3 tacos with rice, beans, and salad. The tacos don't include any filler ingredients like Americans prefer. Just straight up shrimp smothered in oozing melted cheese. Can't get much more legit than that. The rice, beans, and salad were all pretty typical and were a good compliment to the meal.

My husband and I were in PHX for a short vacay and after standing in the Hertz rental car line for 40 freaking minutes, I told him we are not going to Chino Bandido but the closest Mexican restaurant we can find on Yelp with the highest ratings.  Lo' and behold, it was Mariscos Playa Hermosa!  Literally 2 miles from the airport and easy to find.  

We are so glad that we were able to find the best Mexican food we've ever had while in PHX, but it was hard having this as our first meal of the trip.  Every meal after this was just not cutting it.  Therefore, we planned the last day of our trip around the fact that Mariscos Playa Hermosa closed at 8pm on Sundays. 

You really can't go wrong with the menu.  The first time, I ordered Fish Enchiladas and my husband ordered the Garlic Fish platter.  Both were amazing.  Their complimentary ceviche tostada was also delicious, as well as their salsas.   The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Camarones Culichi and my husband ordered another fish dish w/ vegetables.  Both were amazing again.  However, if you go here I would highly recommend the Camarones Culichi.....just because it's not something you find  at any mexican restaurant.  It was so delicious that I licked the plate of sauce clean after eating all of the shrimp, and I don't care how uncouth that might have looked because you will probably end up doing the same.  (Now, if you cannot handle spicy foods, you may want to be very cautious.  Maybe order an Horchata drink to go with the meal, or a side of sour cream to buffer the spiciness.)

They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.

The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.

Great photography opportunities. Very educational. As a family of four midwesterners, we loved walking around looking at the beautifully designed and cared for desert landscape. 

We paid about $40 to get in, for a 16 year old, 6 year old, and two adults. Both times I've gone it has taken me about 3 hours to very leisurely walk the entire gadens with a stop for something to drink and relax.

The best time is to visit in the spring, after a winter of sufficient rainfall. Cacti bloom every year but wildflowers along the pathways and scattered throughout the gardens only bloom when there's been rain in the months prior to warm weather. This year is spectacular. So many flowers and so exotic, even if you've seen desert landscapes all your life.

The butterflies are on show and well worth the $3.50 extra to enter their tent. And abundant wildlife to boot! In the few hours we were here I saw jack rabbits, quails, butterflies, humming birds, iguanas, lizards...

Make sure you take some water with you and apply your sunscreen because even though we went when it was in the 70's we did get some sun and hubs got some red!  Oh, and do wear good walking shoes as there is a lot of ground to cover here. 

You have an amazing array of cacti and other succulents.  The herb garden wasn't all that hot to me but it's there.  They have the volunteers out in different spots who will show you what this plant was used for and things like that.  There was a flute player out the day we went who captivated niece for a good long while.  It is not all flat ground, you will walk a bit uphill at some spots.

The giant insect statues were pretty cool to see but it was just the scenery period that was breath taking.  When the cacti are in bloom it has really got to be amazing.  Throughout the garden there are spots where they have information about the plants or the animals that are around and there are spots that have seats and shade; very necessary if you are really taking in the entire garden.

We were very fortunate as we got to see hummingbirds, cottontails, quails, squirrels, and a road runner.  It costs $18 for adults to get in UNLESS you have reciprocal membership from another garden.  We do, we got in free, woohoo!!!  

If you are into the plant - and animal - life of the southwest then this is a place I highly recommend, just stay on the path and be careful when you back up to take a picture!

I can't believe that I have lived in Phoenix for over ten years and this is the first time I made it to the Botanical Gardens.  I've always heard it was a wonderful place that is known as one of the best desert gardens in the world.  It truly is a world-class venue.  I guarantee I will be walking these gardens often.  But first I will have to purchase an annual membership because the $18.00 entry fee will get expensive very quickly even though it sure was worth every cent.

The Desert Botanical Gardens cover about 140 acres located next to Papago Park and the Phoenix Zoo. Established in 1939, the garden now has more than 50,000 plants, about one-third of which are native to the area, including species which are rare, threatened or endangered. Several ecosystems are represented: a mesquite bosque, semi-desert grassland, and upland chaparral.

The entire venue is impeccably maintained and spotlessly clean!  I can tell the people of Phoenix take great pride in the jewel of the desert. 

The gardens have five trails; the main trail is called the Desert Discovery Loop. Then branching off from this central trail are the plant and people of the Sonoran Desert loop, the Sonoran Desert nature trail, the center for desert living trail and the desert wildflower loop.  

During my time spent at the gardens I encountered desert wildflowers, abundant wild life such as humming birds, butterflies, rabbits, roadrunners, ground rodents and countless  varieties of other birds along with herbs and plants used for food, medicine, shelter and other cultural purposes and cactus so many cactus varieties!

The botanical gardens are so well thought-out that the best way to describe the venue as a whole is simply a work of art!  Oh, did I mention there are wonderful works-of-art scattered through-out the gardens.  Right from the beginning, you know this is someplace special as before you even enter the gardens you come upon a wonderful man made rock formation with three incredible Chihuly glass sculptures titled Desert Towers!

There is a lot of walking to be done here but the designers have obviously made your comfort a priority.  There are drinking fountains everywhere, several restrooms, a café, nice secluded / shaded sitting areas and benches along all the trails.  

My recommendation is: make a day of this, take your time, look everywhere, take photographs, have lunch at the patio café, drink lots of water (you are in the desert), put on some comfortable walking shoes and enjoy the show!",review,1,M93I4fHwf99NmT_xz8C0gA

If you come here without your camera, you'll regret it. I love the desert and I'm a native to AZ and I like coming here to see and learn about the more exotic stuff, like cape aloes, for instance. 

This place really immerses you in the cultural element of AZ. (Somebody already mentioned that they have native flute players.) They have live bands here, they serve alcohol here (and it's still good for kids and fieldtrips). They serve fancy, cold coffee here. Yes, the price is steep. They have a butterfly exhibit that you pay separately for and the steep price is the reason why I think the exhibit should be included in the regular fare. I went here a couple of times when they had the Chiluly art exhibit. (Remember your camera!) They have an annual plant sale with proceeds going to conservation around the state. 

This park is not as big as some have suggested. I know my way around. Don't worry about the map. It's FUN to get lost in this place. The trails are not as up and down as they are at the zoo on the other side of the hill, but rather flatter and easier for older folks. The trails are crowded in March. Try to go on a weekday.

They have botany classes you could take for an extra fee. They teach gardening. I think it would be AWESOME if again, they would include these as part of the regular fare. My beef is this - as somebody who's knowledgable in desert survival, it is really freakin' hard to find classes in such a thing. You have to search far and wide for this kind of information. I understand that people are sue happy and there's bound to be one dork in the class who's deathly allergic to palo verde seeds, but 1) that's what waivers are for 2) you don't have to try the seeds in class, just teach it. I think the DBG is one of the few places that are actually qualified to teach these types of classes and I think it would really set them apart from the other botanical gardens.

Set in Papago Park, next to the Phoenix Zoo, the Desert Botanical Garden features a wide variety of cacti, succulents, and other desert plants on extensive grounds. Many of these plants are native and some are exotic to the Sonoran Desert. They recently created a dramatic entrance, with a front display of large cacti, including saguaro, ocotillo, and organ pipe cactus, that greet you the moment you enter the Garden. The pathways are winding and wonderful, but not so rugged that a person in a wheelchair could not navigate the terrain. Some of the inclines lead you to remarkable views of the cityscape and the surrounding mountains. They also have an excellent gift shop. 

The spring and early summer months, when the desert flowers bloom and it is not too hot during the day, are an excellent time of year to make a visit. Just as good are the holiday weeks in late November and early to middle December, when the Garden holds Las Noches de las Luminarias. This event is similar in concept to the Farolito Walk in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when luminarias (farolitos) line the walkways to softly illuminate your path, hot beverages are sold, and musicians perform throughout the Garden. The year that Chihuly's glass artwork was featured alongside the luminarias was just incredible.

After a full day of eating from the day before, I wanted to do a non food outing. My friend suggested the Botanical Garden which was a 30 minute drive from her place in Scottsdale. The parking lot was packed when we arrived at 930am. My friend was shocked at how crowded it was considering the past few times she'd been here, there'd been plenty of parking spots.  We eventually found a spot by following a couple who were walking back to their car. FYI parking is free but in cases where the parking lot is completely full you may have to wait it out OR possibly forgo visiting the Garden since the parking lot is the only place to park your car--there aren't any side streets to park on. 

As we stood in line to purchase our tickets, surrounded by families with young children, we found out why it was so crazy busy:  the Garden was hosting ""The Great Pumpkin Festival"" which happened to be the same exact weekend we were at the Garden. This Festival offered plenty of activities for families: a hayride; pumpkin carving and decorating; a hay maze; a petting zoo; carnival games; and a free pumpkin for every child under 12.  How cute is that!!!

Admission for adults is $18. My friend had a 50% groupon for herself so her ticket was $9. A random guy came up to us and asked if we wanted his extra coupon that he and his family weren't using. I gladly accepted and once we got to the counter, my admission was free AND I also had FREE access to the butterfly exhibit which wasn't included in my friend's groupon deal. However the admissions guy ended up giving us 2 butterfly admission stickers--1 for me and 1 for my friend. Thanks random guy  & admissions guy for being nice and generous!!  

Off we went to explore the Botanical Garden. My 4 favorite things during my visit:
1) The Chocolate Flower: no joke this is a flower that smells exactly like chocolate; how did I not know about this?!  
2) Upon walking further we approached some cacti that were enormously tall; think sequoia tree height (ok I exaggerate, but these cacti were the tallest I've ever seen). I was in awe.
3) The random tidbits and interactive displays that provide useful information as to what you're seeing or the history behind it. 
4) The layout of the Garden was easy to follow and made it easy to not really miss anything. Upon entering the Garden there's main trail that loops around, but along the main trail there are 4 sub-trails that will loop you back where you turned off of the main trail. My favorite trail was the ""Plants & People of the Sonoran Desert Loop Trail."" 

The weather was warm but bearable. Bring bottled water, sunglasses, hats, and comfortable shoes since there's hardly any shade and most of the trails are dirt trails. We arrived at 9:30am and managed to see most of the Garden, including the Butterfly exhibit, by 11am. 

I absolutely loved visiting this place and wouldn't mind going again especially to the various events they host throughout the year...just another reason to re-visit Phoenix!!! :)",review,2,WPpgplA0tnGn3E65Ng6aYg

It was listed as one of the top 20 must see events in the world. And I couldn't believe that it was right here in my backyard and I've never been.  I couldn't wait to purchase tickets to go.  It sound like it was the best place on earth.  And it was indeed.  The evening spent at the Desert Botanical Garden was worth every penny ($25 per adult w/o dinner).  

The chilled night air was filled with music from over 40 different bands and entertainers.  We heard jazz, native sounds, singing cowboys, bells ringing in harmony and some good ol' holiday favorites.  The best part was sipping rum cider while walking arm in arm with hubby throughout the various bends of the garden.  This event has now become a family tradition.  We missed it last year because we waited till the last minute to get our tickets and they were SOLD OUT! This year, we secured our tickets early.  

Las Noches de las Luminarias is very popular and known world wide.  It runs from the day after Thanksgiving and ends on December 23rd.  It's a wonderful way to bring much happiness in the world and to celebrate the season of giving and goodwill to mankind.",review,0,hGvHc3YnSvAgUhSGEum5cA

Photographers - they have classes you can take where you have access to the garden at night.  What's more awesome than a picture of the full moon with a mighty saguaro in front of it.  They also have smart phone photography classes.  If you don't need a class, there is so much to photograph here.  I've captured amazing shots of hummingbirds, flowers, butterflies, art, and people just to name a few.  An awesome  place to practice your craft.
The events - There is something always going on.  Luminaries, Music in the Garden, Pumpkin Festival, Chocolates and Chiles, Dia de Los Muertos, giant art installations, plant sales, and these are just a few that happen in the fall.  If you had a membership, it could be paid back in unique visits within a couple weeks.
Classes - I already talked about the photography classes (those are the ones I've taken) but there are so many others!  You want to learn how to garden?  Maybe create a drip system?  Blow glass?  Practice Tai-Chi?  Seriously you can do all of this in the most picturesque place Phoenix has to offer.
I'm a huge fan of the garden and recently joined their Monarch Society that includes membership to the garden and has extra special events for young professionals.  That means enjoying everything awesome the garden has to offer with other awesome people.  
They are in the process of building a restaurant there which I am so looking forward to dining at.  What a great location for drinks and fresh local food.

I'm really not a museum-lover, but the botanical gardens have a ton of appealing qualities who can't stand in front of the same piece of art for ten minutes and pretend to think it's interesting or a showcase of masterful talent. For example, the 15-foot tall hairy cactus? I don't have to pretend that it's pretty - it's nature, and maybe it was meant to be like that. Cool. The 6 or 7 different exhibits? I don't have to go see all of them in one visit. Or I can. Both options are completely doable. I can get married there. I can have a snack there. I can get a healthy dose of vitamin D there. I can listen to music and enjoy the setting during Las Noches de las Luminarias. 

If you're an outdoorsy person who needs entertainment that's a difference pace than a hike but aren't ready to go the indoors route, the botanical gardens are a must. I would recommend shorter visits for the winter months, as most of the flowers aren't blooming.

9590,qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w,2,2013-03-03,0,4KdU-cKBl3klKdzfayt9vw,5,"The Desert Botanical Garden is a real treasure. I would rank it right up with the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California as an absolute ""must-not-miss"" regional attraction.

We visited the Garden recently on our ""day off"" between Spring Training games. I had thought it would be worth spending, maybe, an hour or two on, and was actually worried that I hadn't planned anything else to do that day. As it was, we stayed nearly four hours, and are already planning our visit for ""next time.""

The Garden is huge, and is organized along various themed ""loop"" trails. We took the ""Desert Discovery"" loop first, which took us past plants (cacti, succulents, and trees) native to the various deserts of the world. Well-informed and friendly docents staffed stations along the trail, answering questions and demonstrating such things as how the interior of a cactus absorbs water or how the native peoples have used desert plants for everything from construction to medicine. That led to the second trail we chose to explore: ""Plants and People of the Sonoran Desert,"" which explores the ways in which the native and Hispanic peoples who have called this area home throughout the centuries have used the various plants and habitats for everything from food and medicine to shelter, worship, and artwork. After a brief break for lunch, we took a turn on the ""Sonoran Desert Nature Loop Trail,"" which showcases the plants and animals of the Sonoran Desert. We also paid a visit to the succulent and cactus galleries.

The whole place is fascinating, and extremely well-done. We'd have stayed longer if we'd had the energy!

We also saw an amazing array of birds (the quail and the cactus wrens were my favorites). Books posted throughout the exhibits encouraged visitors to record their wildlife sightings, and we were very happy to record that we'd spotted a jackrabbit!

Tours of the Garden are available as part of your admission...we didn't avail ourselves of one this visit, but they sounded interesting.

If you visit, be sure to wear a good sunscreen and a hat, and to carry water with you (you'd be amazed at how quickly you can dehydrate in a desert climate!).

The park has two dining options: A casual cafe and a sit-down restaurant. We chose to eat at the cafe, which features salads and wraps (I had a very satisfying hummus and tabbouli plate). It was interesting to see quail begging for tidbits, as sparrows, starlings, and pigeons do in other habitats (it was also hilarious watching the very territorial ground squirrels chasing the quail!)

The Garden is also enhanced by original artwork, including Philip Haas's intriguing ""Four Seasons.""

Another thing to remember if you visit: allow plenty of time for the very nice gift shop! We managed to pick up unique and affordable gifts for family back home, as well as a couple of souvenirs for ourselves, without spending a lot of money.

We're very glad we chose to spend our free day here, and we will definitely return, should we be fortunate enough to visit the Phoenix area again",review,2,byArOZgSGKFOJnrYhQ0MxQ

Thanks to some ""connections"" that my aunt has, we had free passes to get into DBG, though we did spring for the extra $3.50pp for the Butterfly exhibit (which was a huge indulgence on my part, because butterflies/moths/dragonflied give me the creeps!).

The grounds are beautiful. As you'd expect, it's all about desert landscapes and stuff that can actually grow in the AZ climate. One sad thing is that you could tell how badly alot of plants were harmed due to the ""freak"" snowstorm a couple weeks earlier; some more delicate flowers were clumps of brown, and a lot of cacti (everywhere around the area) had flowerpots over their arm tips. However, the place was still 99% beautiful!!

Loved the Haas ""Seasons"" sculptures; survived the Butterfly exhibit; loved how easy it was to just follow the ""Desert Wildflower Trail"" and leisurely take pics at our own pace; loved the Chihuly glass sculptures!

All in all, loved this place, and cannot wait to come back in the evening to get a different perspective and some awesome sunset pics.

First, we brought my 7 y/o daughter for their sponsored pumpkin ride and picking, which was a bit of a let down. The ride was advertised as a hay ride, but there was no hay to be seen. It was a bit too long, and the pumpkin patch consisted of pre picked pumpkins naturally from a cooler state! Coming from New Jersey, pumpkin hay rides locally are much cooler, but what can you do, this was the best AZ's harsh arid climate has to offer. The local kids were havign a blast, and I understand why.  My daughter thought it was dumb to be honest, as did we, but we all managed to have a bit of fun with it. 

  Onto the actual B.G.s. They were terrific, albeit hot as Hades. It was in the mid '80s the day we were there, and it felt like triple digits to us Yankees lol.  My lips were chapped as all hell after a few hours walking about, it blew my mind. The ground heats up in excess of 10 to 20 degrees in excess of the air temperature on any given day at the gardens. Bare that in mind when visiting. The admission price was reasonable. There is terrain consisting of novice to moderate grades of walking. Other areas are paved and consist of very mild walks, leisure and enjoyable.  The latest glass cactus additions were marvelous. Coming from outside the Southwestern USA, it is a must see experience, to walk amongst the natural beauty that consists of the deserts of Arizona. 

  There is plenty of free parking. Since my first and last visit there in 2009, the park has added an upscale gift shop and restaurant. I kid you not, the restaurant was five stars in itself! Offering cooked per order, organic dishes and drinks. It was so refreshing and tasty after hours in the blazing hot sun. A bit pricey but well worth it, my family and I concluded. Prompt and curtious service included. The gift shop is a bit of a tourist trap today, offering an array of tacky to note worthy items, all at tourist based prices!

The collection of plants is extensive and impressive, the way it's organize and displayed throughout the garden makes turning every corner an adventure, and their dedication to showing off the beauty of the desert is enough to make any Phoenician proud. If you are a photographer, this is one of the best places in Phoenix you can go for a wide variety of photo opportunities, any time of day and any time of year.

I have lived here for just a little over 2 years, and I think I've been to the Gardens 5 or 6 times.  I'm from Tennessee and used to love going to their botanical gardens, but the DESERT Botanical Gardens are unlike anything I've ever seen!  I just love walking around there, and I feel like I discover something new every time I'm there.  I love the Chihuly exhibit that's there now.  I've seen it twice.  They also have some wonderful events there.  My favorite is Corks and Cactus, their wine tasting event, which I attended last weekend.  What could be better than wine tasting followed by wandering around amidst a bunch of cacti?  ;)  One of the best trips I had there was in April one year because so many of the cacti were in bloom.  Prior to that, I don't even think I knew that cacti did bloom!  It's just a great place to be.  If you're local and you haven't been, you need to take advantage of having this place nearby!  Get a list of their events!  I took my boyfriend for the first time, and, once he started walking around, he said that he couldn't believe he'd lived here for 2 years and had never been.  If you're visiting, this is definitely a unique way to explore Arizona--it's the Sonoran Desert compressed into an area that you can walk through in a couple of hours!  But if you're going in or close to the summer, be sure to wear a hat and cool clothes, as there's not much shade.  Also, I would recommend skipping their restaurant, Gertrude's.

Amber Hahn, the coordinator, was extremely helpful and responsive to our needs. She also acted as our point person for the ceremony as far as timing and even helped out when our minister accidentally forgot some important parts and we had to do it all over again! (Which just added to the charm!)

As part of our process, we did a site visit, a walk through, a rehearsal and of course, the main event! We all felt very comfortable with how the day would go and appreciated all of the practice rounds and visits!

The ceremony space at the Webster Center is breathtaking! The few photos we have received completely capture the Sonoran Desert beauty and we are just so pleased with the million options we had!

The staff, including the beverage manager, Marianne Donnan, and her team were wonderful and easy to work with! Two thumbs up!

We also absolutely loved that we could have our ceremony, cocktail hour, plus dinner and dancing in one general area! It made the evening flow so smoothly! Also, the space was extremely accommodating for our guests who required accommodations or wheelchairs. There is nearby parking, bathrooms on one level and ramps as needed.

I have seen one of Chihuly's art work, and so had an idea of what to expect and have to say it exceeded my  expectations.  The colored lights and glass was striking from the get go.

I mean it was dark and some of the artwork looked like it was from a Star Wars movie!  

My favorites were the orange orb with snake like protrusions, the blue orb at the entrance,  the lavender colored stakes, the water display with the frogs croaking  and tall glass ball column.

It's worth mentioning that my youngest son was so excited to see this exhibit that he kept bouncing around and kissing my arm and calling me the best mommy ever for bringing him.

My favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas, kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good!; 2) the yucca frita, fried yucca plant (very starchy, like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink, a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream, a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods, but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious.

I ordered the iced tea, which was extremely refreshing, and my boyfriend had the horchata. Their horchata wasn't bad, just less sweet than we've ever had before. 

As for the food, we order 1 bean and cheese pupusa and one meat and cheese. I think the meat and cheese had more flavor, but the bean and cheese was still pretty good.

For our main meal, I got the bistec encebollado and my boyfriend ordered the carne asada. The bistec was delicious! It came with rice and beans and was smothered with the onion gravy. It also came with a small bowl of some other gravy-type food. It was a little gritty for my liking so I didn't  use it with anything.

Those dishes are so good, wonderfully flavored and full of awesome. I love spinach, my sister hates it. Once I got her to try the palak panner she was hooked! Now we fight over who gets the last piece of cheese. Their chicken tikka is the best I've had. The chicken is flavorful and the sauce has a creamy and silky texture, perfect to dip your naan in. We've also had their butter chicken and chicken curry. Both were excellent. They also offer traditional Indian dinners (vegetarian and meat) which have a little bit of everything. They're great for introducing Indian food to first timers. Oh, and the mango lassi is delicious! Since everything is a la carte it can get pricey, but the portions are generous. I have yet to try their lunch buffet.

It has a really nice atmosphere and is never overly crowded so you can have a nice conversation. The decor is also lovely. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They have a small market attached full of spices, medicines, bangles, hena kits and other various food items.

- PRICE. With the yelp deal its incredibly cost effective to get full off of good indian food. 

- The food was good, not great, not bad, but good. 

Of course I always compare a meal relative to how much I paid. I paid $5 dollars for AYCE indian food that had a decent selection of food, all of which was delicious. For 5 bucks this place is as good as it gets.

This was my first time eating Indian food and I am now a new  fan of it! My cousin who loves Indian food and was visiting from LA said it was the best Indian food she has ever had! The location is cool because they give you a taste of the Indian style and culture from the moment you enter the parking lot where the building has a palace shape and their is a cool looking mural on the large wall. The inside is pretty nice and the Indian cultural theme continued here with a homely feel because it is owned by one family it seemed. The chicken masala I ordered was impeccable and just my taste at a level 6 spiciness and the garlic naan was mouthwatering with the yogurt dipping sauce.

i enjoyed all the veggie options. the curries were thick and full of lentils/spinach/potatoe, etc. the rice was fluffy, despite being in a buffet. even the pudding desert dish, with cashews and raisins was tasty. a bit sweet, but good. 

there are about 6 chutneys and sauces to compliment your dish if you choose. i always like the yogurt ones. the achar was way too salty for me. our indian guest was well pleased and we took that as a good sign.

Scene: April 2007.
Reason: The Shins

INCREDIBLE. 
This venue offers an intimacy that most don't, including places like the Marquee, Clubhouse and Rhythm Room. Which, if you think about it, is ironic since at Celebrity, you get to call dibs on some pretty amazing seats. Don't expect to be able to see the band, though, if you decide to sit. The entire crowd stood the entire time The Shins played. (Word to the wise: wear comfy shoes!)

My only beef with Celebrity is that they don't bring enough acts to Phoenix that would have me doing 15 cartwheels in excitement. But, when they do bring in somebody, like The Shins, it's worth every penny and every second of my time!",review,3,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA

I'm from California so everytime I go to a concert it has been crazy expensive to sit up close and there are assigned seats (which I can't stand). Sure, I've been to concerts without seats, but they were music festivals (Rock the Bells) and it took hours to slowly move close to the stage. At Celebrity Theatre we were able to be right at the stage and even touched the artists' (E-40, DJ Quik, Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony) hands as they performed directly to us. We even caught DJ Quik''s t-shirt!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the rotating stage, it gives everyone in the crowd an opportunity to have a great view of the performers. These seats in CA would have been an arm and a leg, I feel lucky to have been able to be so close to the performers for ~$20 General Admission.

Yes, the seats are fairly small and the legroom wasn't great, but that didn't really take much away from the experience.

I want to give an immediate five stars to Dr. Hurowitz of the Medical Sub specialty Clinic.  I will also give those five stars to the young gentleman at the front desk of said clinic.  I will edit this review to give that person's name and the name of a person from another department at a later date.

Why five stars to these people?  My friend was truly suffering from an acute flare up of rheumatoid arthritis.  When I arranged with the front desk to get a wheelchair stat the next day, it happened.  Dr. Hurowitz spent ten minutes with my friend and had her in a hospital bed forty five minutes later.  It was heartening to see a physician recognize that a fifty eight year old woman who could hardly walk and was swollen to about three times her body size all over had a real problem which is more than I could say for the ED Department.  On top of that, Dr. H showed an incredibly compassionate attitude in working with my friend, Mary Lou, and believe me she needed it.

We have been back to the clinic after Mary Lou spent five days in the hospital and had what seemed, every test know to man run on her and was seen by  as many Dr's in every area.  He is realistic enough with her to say that my friend's condition is unusual and there is more work to be done.

I'd been having problems with my tmoblie pearl blackberry for over a week but didn't feel like dealing with tmobile customer service as it can sometimes take hours and I was not feeling so patient.

So, I called in first and spoke with Matt... he told me that it sounded like my problem was that I needed a new speaker and that they could probably fix it but wouldn't know for sure unless I brought it in.  He also told me that they would not charge me if they could not fix the problem.  Deal!

Instead of dealing with the people at tmobile and probably spending hours on the phone, I was in and out of Sun Cellular in half an hour.  For only $35, it was well worth it!  My phone is fixed and it was hassle free!  I was even able to catch a few minutes of Oprah on the tv in the shop while I waited!

Matt helped me out and I met the owner, Dan, as well... While I waited, several other customers were in and out and I witnessed the excellent customer service Sun Cellular provided.

If you want an HONEST assessment of the extent of your phone repair, and competent, reliable, and fairly priced service, Sun Cellular is the place to go.  If you want a pretty picture, a low ball price, then an unpleasant surprise once the other guy has torn your phone down, go somewhere else.

Brought a phone in with an oddball part needing replacement, that needed to be ordered.  Dan was very specific; he let me know the part was unusual and needed to be ordered from manufacturer, how long it would take to get it, and the cost.  I wasn't thrilled with the wait or the cost of the part.

I called a few other places, who told me ""yeah, we can have that done today (or tomorrow)..."", widely varied pricing, all on the low side.   I asked them to verify that they had the correct part in, and NONE of them had it, and the cost and the wait time went up with all of them.  I can just see it now... you bring the other guys your phone, they tear it down, THEN tell you ""oops, gonna hafta wait, cost is higher"".  Now you're a captive audience, and they have your phone.

My Apple iPhone4's battery has been on its last legs the past few months (the fact that Apple cannot put a battery in their $400 phones that can last more than a year is another debate for another review). Fortunately, a friend gave me an unused spare, so I was prepared to just do the work myself.  I had the proper tools but when it came to removing the battery to replace it with a new one, I was stymied trying to remove the one stupid 2.5 mm screw that kept the battery connection in place.

Concerned that I might ""strip"" the screw completely if I tried to keep muscle-ing it, I sought expert help to see how much it would cost just to take the stupid screw out for me. That's it. Nothing more. I'll take it from there.  As a self-employed professional myself, I don't expect anyone to work or put in their time for free and I was prepared to pay a reasonable amount for whoever did the work's time and trouble.  I did a Google search and came up with three establishments in my immediate area.  The first one did not answer the phone(in fairness, it was lunch time), and the third one, rather dismissively, came up with some lamea*s excuse about the screw being stripped and maybe needing a new connector and said, I quote:  ""I can't help you, man"".  I won't mention this establishment by name, but suffice to say they are located at the NE corner of 7th St. and Union Hills and their number is 480-559-9694.  My 2nd call was to Sun Cellular and the phone was answered by a young fellow named Issac.  I explained my problem to him and what I needed done and, after listening and confirming all I needed was the screw taken out, he invited me to come on down.

About an hour later, when I came in to their shop off Bell Rd., a young man behind the counter was the first to greet me.  Turns out it was Issac.  I re-introduced myself and my problem and he kindly took my phone in back to take a look.  I had barely had the chance to sit down in their comfortable waiting area when he popped out of the back smiling, holding the tiny screw in one hand and my iPhone and back cover (I had pre-removed the pentalobe screws so as to take up less of his time) in the other.  Hallelujah!   I then asked if I could pay some sort of ""diagnostic"" or other j*rkoff fee for their labor and trouble, but Issac said that it was no big deal.  I asked him if he was sure, as I had no problem paying something for their assistance, and Issac kindly declined again.  In fact, a slightly older fellow who was also behind the counter (who, I'm guessing, may be the owner/proprietor) chimed in with, ""Anyone who would charge you for that should be shot...""  Wow.

In this day and age, it is so rare to find such friendly and service-oriented professionals--particularly when it comes to repair of consumer electronics.  The reviews you read on this Yelp listing are clearly no joke.  These guys are the real deal, and iPhone repair shops throughout the Valley (including the last crew that fixed my phone) could learn a lot from them.

Walked in later afternoon and a 30 minute wait turned into a 10 minute wait!  Fast, friendly service and no upsell!  Price is what its going to be

Would highly recommend for any mobile phone service!",review,0,W1Z7T5trNCMaFgl0LIHGFA

The touch screen on my Motorola Maxx was cracked due to something that fell on it - freak accident. In mid-August I dropped my phone off knowing he had Motorola brand touch screens on order since mid-June. Thankfully I still had my old phone because I had only upgraded phones recently. He said I would be first in line when he received the needed part. Just got it back and am happy with paying the $250 instead of $700 for a replacement. Other cell phone services were charging the same price for off brand touch-screens. I will recommend Sun Cellular to everyone I know and will do business with him again, but hopefully I won't need to!",review,0,8F_Z0JF86NlyLUIMJnDojg

I replaced my iPhone battery phone with them twice in one day and when it still did not work (because my phone is faulty, not my battery) they told me I could come back in for a full refund, no questions asked. I can't say enough nice things about Sun Cellular. Honest, knowledgable, and quick!",review,0,llcAD6C00C7pvaNFq-gSaA
