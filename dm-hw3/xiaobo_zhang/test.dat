Our host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  

The bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  

For the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. 

Craig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.

Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. 

I gave it a shot and I was impressed! 

First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. 

The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. 

The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. 

Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. 

The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. 

Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.

The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.

A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat.

Back to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  

My husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.

I explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a ""closer"" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.

Fortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.

Did I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.

To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company. Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. 

The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar.

I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. 
One advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. 
The parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed.

I've never really had a bad experience with Enterprise, but this location in particular is just full of really nice people.  Fatima in particular is so sweet, remembers my name and where I live, and goes above and beyond to make me feel like a valued customer. 

It's really nice to feel like employees of anywhere recognize you as a good customer and treat you with mutual respect, kindness, and reward your loyalty. We all know that the squeaky wheel gets the oil, so it's nice to see positive karma reinforced at Enterprise. 

Once they called me to let me know I had left a burned cd in their disc player and offered to drop it off with me while they were out doing their pick-ups. WHO DOES THAT? These guys do. Because they are awesome.

 Another time, there was a bit of a wait (they were insanely busy just before a holiday weekend, but still smiling and keeping it cool, even though I could see the exhaustion in their eyes) because they were backed up on getting their cars cleaned on the inside before they could ok them for rent.
 I told them I didn't really care, had no one to impress, and they could give me a dirty car as long as there wasn't literally bodily fluids inside it. Save yourselves a few minutes on cleaning that, I'm probably going to put new trash and crumbs in it shortly anyway. 

They looked at me, and told me that they appreciated my sentiment and apologize for the wait, but they would feel bad about giving me a crumby car. So, tell you what. Lets just bump you up the list of cars and give you a free upgrade to a higher class of car, of which we already have one cleaned and ready.  I said that wasn't necessary, I wasn't in a rush.  They said they wanted me to have it, because I was so nice and a good customer besides. Well. I guess if you insist on a free upgrade... I'll take it. 

I like that the corporate Enterprise seems to value this sort of behavior in it's employees, and fosters a positive work environment.

The bike shop is a middle-sized shop, so they might not have as much variety of products as other huge bike shops. The nice thing is, they are willing to go out of the way to order something for you, even if you just wanted one piece of something. Also, it is a great place to stop by for last minute maintenance, quick fixes. They usually have a long wait for huge project fix ups, but if you just need a quick check or putting on a saddle, something fast, they will do it on the spot and you won't run into the long wait time.

I trust them to do a good job for my bike. Jacob, who I regularly see in the bike shop, was very detailed in explaining my options when I wanted to add gears to my single speed bike. He even suggested maybe building a custom bike might be something I should consider since my Sanwa is not exactly meant for touring.. A week and a half later (I was out of town), my bike was ready.

Indeed, Madison abounds with options for a gal like me, but Monty's marks my favorite eatery in the city. Intentionally old-school in its decor and prices, it's a throwback that appeals to anyone with a frontal cortex. 
My waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home-made veg soup as I was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn't seen me for a few minutes (aaaaand the tip started to go up).  I had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here, and good LORD the portion size was outta control. The roll was the size of a Yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato, fancy that. The meatless loaf itself was solidly good (shredded root veg with a cheesy binder - wish I had known that prior to ordering, but should've asked) but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood. So many great-looking options for veg-heads like myself, hallelujah a-MEN, and they even have a small wine list and beer. 
I couldn't get through the entire pile of food, despite being a hormonal food warrior that day, yet I craved a sweet and Monty's has soy ice cream. WTF, OTHER DINERS? I nearly wept at this one. I had the mint chip, 2 scoops, which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl. That, I could do. 
My total bill came to $8. EIGHT. I added a 50% tip and blew Monty's a kiss as I left; I shall RETURN! Waitress was a sweetie, the staff all seemed to be pretty happy, and the place was approaching fullness when I left.

There is also a mini kitchen you can use, if needed, with snacks. Our room was a very good size and it was neat and clean. We had a tv and dvd player with movies to choose from.

As a result, they focus on value and entertainment. 

Inexpensive tickets, good and reasonable food/beverages are a Godsend. I just came from Milwaukee -- three tickets with views that do not require binoculars will run you over $100. A crap beer (Miller brands) in a plastic bottle runs another $6.50. The food is overrated and also price-inflated. At the warm Warner Park, I was able to get a seat right behind the dugout (word is that they are County Stadium relics) for $10! They offer 18 different beers including incredible Microbrews collectible plastic cups for $3.50 or less! Besides great beer, there were funnel cakes, TURKEY LEGS, burgers, brats and MUCH MORE. Their wait staff (yes, wait staff) is friendly and efficient with your orders, so you can enjoy the show. 

Four mascots are always running around the stadium rally-mongering and adding to the enjoyment. In between innings, the festivities including a t-shirt toss, bat spin, children and mascot races and more. The PA announcer consistently appeals to the good-natured (but peculiar) kitsch that fills a family-oriented outing (refers to foul balls as wieners or frankfurters for no particular reason). Check their web site -- their dates are chock-full of promos including autographed balls, celebrities (like the Fridge, Webster, Chewbacca and more) and post game events.

My general admission Duck Blind ticket was $33 for a Friday night game - but the experience of trying to get my money's worth was priceless. All-you-can-eat ballpark food (which is perfectly adequate ballpark food, nothing to rave about) and all-you-can-drink adult beverages (from a fairly extensive beer list)? Challenge accepted. 

There is another Duck Blind section that costs a bit more than the general admission. I think it includes a reserved picnic table and a better view of the game; however, if you're willing to come to the regular Duck Blind section soon after the gates open (90 minutes before the game), you can call dibs on a table in the cheaper section. 

Overall, it was a great value for 4 1/2 hours of food, beverage and entertainment. I won't be back every weekend - for the sake of my waistline - but it's definitely a fun way to spend a summer night in Madison.",review,0,Q-dOxBJ7Bui_ytR4uE1baQ

I think it's really important to head in to your first (or any) mallards game with the right mind set. This isn't MLB! If you want that that head to a Brewers game in Milwaukee (NOT a Cubs game at Wrigley :p). 

As this is not MLB, the stadium is smaller and really easy to navigate through. I would imagine this would be really good for families looking for a night out. There is a decent sized kids area near the entrance as well. 

For a smaller stadium there is a really impressive amount of food and drink options. There are over 17 different beers available plus people selling Seagrams escape drinks (supposedly gluten free!), lime-a-Ritas etc. I was expecting pretty limited options for food as this is a smaller stadium but they really have everything you can get at an MLB game. Brats, burgers, chicken sandwiches, even cheese curds! There are even gluten free hamburger AND brat buns. Basically a food coma waiting to happen for anyone with celiac disease/gluten intolerance. The staff at all the food and drink stands was really friendly and quick!

Wisco fans everywhere are pretty chill but even more so here! Everyone is just here to have a good time and nobody gets really competitive about the game.

Great Baseball at a reasonable price. You get to watch some of the best College prospects in the country at a state of the art Minor League Stadium. A baseball junkie like me couldn't ask for anything more. 

 Like most Minor League teams, the Mallards kept us entertained with a wide variety of gimmicks. My Visit coincided with Fathers day so there was a meat raffle for the Dads that I gladly entered. I don't have any kids, but I wasn't going to let that get in between me and my meat. There was also a dance off between the Grounds Crew and a Mascot, t-shirt t throws and lots of other interesting side shows. Fans who catch foul balls can even trade it in for a free Hot Dog. Although I have to admit that its a little annoying when the PA announcer yells Wiener after every foul ball.  

 I'd like to say my day with the Madison Mallards ended on a happy note. But I have to sadly report I went home without any free Fathers Day meat.

Oh wait, I'm hallucinating again.

But seriously, this place is wonderful.  I love going here, and I do wish my backyard looked like this.

Unfortunately for me, I brought a minor with me.  Minor claims to love nature and wants to see it up close and personal, but at the same time is deathly afraid of bees and butterflies.  Most people can understand being fearful of bees and their stings, but butterflies?  

It's the kind of irrational fear I can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallow.

If you were there today, you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire, screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction, otherwise known as butterflies.  

I thought I could convince minor to hold my hand and ""trust"" that I wouldn't let anything bad happen, but apparently I'm a lousy saleswoman and/or my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent.  Dang!!!

Minor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave.  A wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car, far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing, face smashing butterflies of satan.

My friend is a UW student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat. We ordered the brisket, rib and chicken. The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy. I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. 

I tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout. My friend placed an order of the 'doughnuts' as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits. We waited and waited, ordered them to-go and even then they weren't ready.

I could go on, but let me put it this way: Next Monday I'm flying into Madison for work for what will likely be my last trip to WI for a while. My coworkers and I have already agreed that we're driving straight from the airport to get lunch. Now I just need to decide... ribs or brisket?

The first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.

Oh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.

The sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.

The highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.

Smoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.  The prices are good, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect.  We will be going back sooner rather than later.",review,2,HSAur8_f6rSTsgRS_S-_rw

Walking in it's clear what your in for. Jon has rib credentials! The walls are covered in awards and certificates the guy has won. Best sauce, best ribs,  best this, best that. You don't get the awards this place has without knowing what you're doing.

I almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?). The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs. I've tried a few of the sandwiches, but I always end up coming back to the ribs because that's where this place really shines. 

The sides are also very good. The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites. I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans. The french fries are good enough if you get takeout from Smoky's (just because they travel a bit better than something like cole slaw), but with so much other great stuff to try you are really ripping yourself off if you stick to them.

I had a very specific look I wanted, and she was able to take the cute Pinterest photos I provided as inspiration and create truly spectacular arrangements using the elements I loved.  She worked hard to figure out which local flowers would be available at the time, and as a result we only had to have a few things that were sourced regionally instead of locally - very cool!! 

The flowers were all beautifully packaged and well labeled, as well, which made it easy for the folks setting up the morning of. Sally also had some great ideas that contributed to our day, as I probably wouldn't have gone hunting for vintage lace for my bouquet handle without prompting.  It made a lovely addition.

If there's something specific you're looking for, you're bound to find it here.

Only things I'd say they can improve upon:
1. The deli counter. I know it's supposed to be super good quality deli meats but every single time I've gotten some they are pretty dry. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong kind? (Suggestions anyone?)

2. The sushi area. I've never actually tried it but it always looks a little scary.

3. The prepared foods section. I tried getting a salad or something here once and the man working behind the counter had no idea what was in anything. Since I'm gluten intolerant this can be pretty important.

At first you may feel some sticker shock when you see the prices however, you need to have an idea before you pull up if you want either a full service wash or the pricier fast detail service.  Don't worry, the friendly service advisors are not on the hustle. The staff is very honest and even handed me the iPhone I forgot on the seat as I got out of the car.

The Diamond Package is your best bet and unless you are have a real messy car, your sure to get a good, through wash.

(Although I didn't know it) My engine belt broke on my way to work while driving on the highway. I managed to get safely to work and I ended up calling Virginia Auto Service upon the recommendation of a friend. Within minutes of talking to Matt he had provided an initial assessment (which turned out to be correct) and advised me how to proceed. He encouraged me to get the car towed and was VERY clear that he would rather I bring my car to another shop if it was less expensive for me and/or safer. How refreshing! He also took the time to look at a similar car in his lot so as to better inform me of possible scenarios.... all before I had committed to utilizing his services. 
I towed it to Virginia Auto Service (thanks for instructing me to contact my insurance company- towing was free) where it was assessed, fixed, cleaned and ready in hours. 
I really really felt like Matt wanted to educate me about my car and ensure my safety before getting my business. 
I cannot compare their prices to another shop's but I would rather have caring, honest and thorough mechanics than a cheap bill.

1. Everyone is professional and very nice.  That's not a given at every auto shop.
2. Honest service - Several times, I've asked them to look at something and to do the service only if it needs it (for example, if my car's manual suggests something at a certain mileage).  Many shops would just take the opportunity to do the service and charge you.  However, Virginia Auto has come back to me several times and said that things look fine now and that they'll check it again at my next oil change.

I took my car in as it was time for an oil change and I was convinced my serpentine belt was about to go.  It had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous.  Turns out I had a loose oil-filter from my last oil change and dripping oil + catalytic converter = my car is about to die smell.

Virginia Auto Service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine.  It was so nice to receive a call from them saying my belt was fine and an oil change was all I needed.  It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example).

It is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car.  Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special?  Yes, but it was so worth it!

Let's just say that the quality ingredients and enticing flavors made us feel a little less homesick. The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos.

Learn it. Order it. Love it.

It's mussel soup. I don't care if you don't like seafood, you will love this. You might think it's just sauce that the mussels are served in. It's soup. You will drink it, and you will wipe up every last drop with your fingers. There is nothing else like it. I'm serious. This is the stuff late-night cravings are made of. 

The pad thai is good, but you can experiment here, ask the waitress for ideas, and know that you'll end up with something different and exciting. There are a few dishes that are acquired tastes (I'm learning to love wild boar), but because I eat here, I get to say ""I eat wild boar!"" and it makes me sound like a better person. And I'm pretty sure eating wild boar does make me a better person, at least to Lost groupies.

My main criticism is that they can sometimes hold back on the heat. It's not enough to say you want it hot. They'll assume you mean ""American hot."" Make sure to specify ""Thai hot."" The burn is good.

You must save room for dessert. This is essential. It will show you another side of Thai you may not have experienced before. I wouldn't go here just for desert, but drinks + dessert = win.

The inside is white tablecloths and candles. This is where you take a date, where the hostess will make sure you're happy and the waitresses will keep your glass always full. And you can see the kitchen from every table, so it feels like you're taking your date to a favorite neighborhood family restaurant (you are, and it is).  The only problem is the bar, which usually has a few sad people at it. I like to think it just adds to the neighborhood feel.

The patio is fun, with great seating arrangements, misters, and a vibrant atmosphere during the evening (don't sit here for lunch). It can be a little difficult to get service on the patio unless it's already packed. If you're with friends who want to hang out, choose the patio. It's great for spending the evening, with good drink service and lively conversation going on all around you.

I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.

Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.

If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.

The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.

Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.

Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees.

This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. 

The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.

The Food and Drinks:
Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.

Appetizers:
We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.

Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.

Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!

Wild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.

Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.

Hot Pot:
We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.

Main Course:
I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!

Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.

Desert:
OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!

Will I go back?
I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.

We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.

The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity.

I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. 

This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. 

As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).

No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).

Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)

Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)

The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) 
You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. 

There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. 

I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.

I had the unpleasant event of waking up with a kidney stone at 3 a.m. To make matters worse, try typing in ""contracting lower back pain, third trimester pregnancy,"" on the web, instant scare considering I am only 29 weeks. I  called the after hours number and my call was returned by Laura, literally within two minutes. She calmly instructed me to go down to maternal triage at my hospital. I was greeted by Dr. Thompson, who just so happened to be hanging out at the hospital at 4 am, and treated within 45 minutes of making my first call.  This experience alone makes me feel confident when I go into labor this Sept, I know I will have the support of the team as promised.

We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  

We started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. 
For dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing.

Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision. And lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown, cash only, and offers no warranties/returns... seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions.  But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.

Phoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking ""Made in China"" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.

Phoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.

As for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said ""He is just really fair.""

St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. 

I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. 

During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. 

Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. 

There isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.",review,13,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.

One could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. 

A final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world ""beautiful"" to describe any building in Phoenix.

In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the ""children's area"" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).

Adult admission is $10 and students are only $5.

I was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - For 200 years, Native Americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man's version of civility.  Not until the 1960's (and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the Native American Languages Act) has the United States finally reversed course and decided to protect the various Native American cultures.  Sad, but true, and something your average American probably doesn't know and likely doesn't want to know or care to know.

Thankfully there are places like the Heard Museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the Southwest.  I feel it is unduly categorized as an ""Art Museum"" by many instead of an ""American History"" museum.  Yes, you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and Kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing, the traditional cooking, the language component, and most importantly the history lesson.  If you leave here thinking, ""that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls"" then you've totally missed the point.

The first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe.  Obviously there are many similarities, but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes.  It also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when I was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern Native American art (sculpture and paintings and jewelry).  There is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend, often far from their homes and at extremely young ages, to strip them of their cultural heritage.  My favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit, likely meant for children but I couldn't keep away from it.  So what if I'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower?  There is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-American indigenous art and garb.

What an excellent excellent museum.  You leave much more informed and with a necessary touch of white guilt.",review,6,WZCAwPXauKtNoAhHK2-pCA

There's plenty of free parking here which was useful as we had a rental, but I did notice that there's a metro stop right outside which should make this a very accessible location.

It was average price-wise for museums these days so I don't knock it for that. When you fully explore every part of the museum I felt it was worthwhile.

I don't profess to be an expert on Native American history (save Geronimo) so if your knowledge is a bit lacking in this area then this is the place to help fill in the gaps. It was definitely a lot of learning for one day but enjoyable and eye-opening at the same time.

The mock school area of how native americans were forced to integrate was probably the most fascinating part for me. As much as the fact that it was only a few decades ago that the school closed. You usually think of this in the Wild West over a hundred years ago.

It's a good half day to explore the museum at a fair clip and probably a full one if you stopped to inspect and read every exhibit.

I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.  I am passionate about this school.

I will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?  

My son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  

We were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.

And, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  

He loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.

Then the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.

The school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.

Weekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.

There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.

But while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.

The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

My friendly server gal showed up right away with good toasted tortilla chips and a cup of their spicy hot, pureed red salsa.  Next came a small bowl of their Soup of the Day, which was Conchigliette y Carne Deshebrada in a tomato based sauce.  Yum!  (Having soup included witl lunch at no extra charge is one of things that make this place special!) 

At the right time, my big platter of the main courses arrived.  Everything was beautifully placed, & the chile came stuffed with Queso Oaxaca, breaded, deepfried, and treated to some delicious toppings.  Along side was the tasty, good-sized chicken steak plus generous servings of creamy tasting, cheese coated refried beans & fluffy Spanish Rice.

I, on the other hand, was just excited about seeing this musical (and staying out late on a work night, Tee hee!)

Now, I have to admit I started comparing this production against the movie. So I initially was thinking, ""Wait, Fontine was brunette"" and ""Hugh Jackman delivered that line differently"" before I allowed myself to be consumed by the musical. Because it truly was beautiful and masterfully played out on the modest sized stage. It received Terry's seal of approval. Bravo!

A couple of things I think really contributed to my enjoyment of this musical were 1) the lovely senior citizens who were bused in, and their darling commentary during the production; and 2) killer seats, front row stage left.

Of course the serving size is generous, I usually make it a point to not finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips.

Using Meetways.com to find a halfway point, I then took the results to Yelp to see what restaurants are in the area (I prefer to find the good local places, rather than a chain, which I'm sure is true for most Yelpers). Anyways, saw the great reviews and decided to check this place out.

We both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious as others have said. Very nice portions too as neither of us downed the whole bowl. Where this place really shines, though is the service. An older woman, who I'm guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned, was walking around conversing with the patrons. It's a small place so she was able to check with everyone on multiple occasions during the time we were there. 

Her service was absolutely delightful. When I received my food first (I had ordered a couple minutes before, so my friend had just finished ordering when I got my meal), she came over to the table and informed that the young lady would not think I was rude if I started eating before she was served. A moment later, she came back with my friend's food as she told us that she ""has pull around here"" lol. I'm guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer, so sorry about the added wait if that's the case, random stranger. A while later she came back to give us free refills of our large drinks. 

I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again, and might have to order something different. A wonderful experience that was truthfully what motivated me to actually sign up for Yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an ""outsider""

The only negative was that the parking is very limited, but then again I did go during the lunch rush. My friend was able to get a spot in their lot but I wound up having to park in a different lot just north of it. It was maybe only 30 feet further away, I just wasn't sure if I would be towed or not.",review,0,Mx-sM8KX667x9EMmrj8NsQ

The gyoza is deep fried deliciousness and comes in pork or shrimp (I think? I opted for pork) and it is BOMB! 

And the Oyako was amazing, grilled chicken cooked perfectly, and blended with light eggs, veggies and rice that added a sweetness to the chicken and eggs. Amazing balance in this dish. Whole meal was like $10 too, and that includes a ""medium"" lemonade which is actually HUGE!! Seriously, get a small lol

All in all I greatly enjoyed myseld, and the service is off the charts. They do everything they possibly can to make sure you're enjoying your meal, and all with huge smiles on their face, like they enjoy their job or something. Weird lol

Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! 

We had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!

I picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot!

When I say something is good, I mean handcrafted, fresh ingredients, bursting with legitimate flavor good. 

But enough about me. You want to know about Blue Fin, so here's the lowdown: 

- Super clean digs and friendly, wonderful personal service from the most adorable little ladies.
 
- Tender (non-bouncy) char-grilled teriyaki chicken thoroughly marinated in a not-too-sweet sauce that tastes slightly fermented (in the best way) with a touch of sesame. 

- Great steamed veggies that melt in your mouth served with perfectly cooked brown rice.

- Flavorful miso with generous chunks of tofu.

- Wonderful house made sauces. My favorite is the sweet and sour sauce, the kind they serve with spring rolls and dumplings, it's tangy and full of fresh ginger.

- Affordable prices, generous portions, and great for healthier mid-week dinner take-out if you can get there before 6:30.

Its a pretty basic sandwich shop, that caters to students and employees at ASU's Mercado buildings on Van Buren, and to a lesser extent the UA College of Medicine across the street, and Heritage Square. Its too bad the storefront is so hidden - you have to know exactly where you're walking or you'll miss it, and its not at all visible from the street.

I'm not sure what upsets everyone so much about the prices - this isn't Subway, their sandwiches are much more substantial, and you get chips (plain Lays potato chips) in the bag with your sandwich. Most of the sandwiches are between $6 - $7, but that's what you'd pay at Corner Bakery or really any non fast-food-chain or sandwich shop these days. Also, it's a local business for goodness sake, in downtown Phoenix no less, so consider the fact that they represent exactly the kind of economic activity this part of the city needs. There's some cheaper pre-made sandwiches and snacks for sale if you're really so concerned.

Despite having just compared it to generic fast food, the service really is quite fast. Unfortunately, there isn't room in the tiny shop for any tables, but you can order a sandwich and they'll have made it in 2-5 minutes while you wait.

I now frequent the Central Ave. location and the food is still as good as it's always been.  

If all that matters to you is ambiance, this is probably not the place for you. Honey Bear's is all about the food.

Someone complained that the pork was too soggy.  Another that the pork was too dry.  HOW can it be both??  The pulled pork IS ""soggy"" because it's JUICY!  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE for!

Someone actually dissed the barbecue sauce!  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west, and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found.  

The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth), I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs.  So, I tried the spare ribs and, while they are good, they just don't compare to the baby backs.

I had never tasted ""collard greens"", so I decided to try them.  Now I'm hooked.  Since I liked them so much at HB's, I ordered them when I went to Notorious P.I.G., another barbecue restaurant. I had to throw those away...they were loaded with vinegar.

I will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork, pulled chicken, and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants).

After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies?  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4.75 stars
Service - 3.75 stars
Overall - 4.5 stars

This is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.

The sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, eh?

Our main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. 

Bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  

Price for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.

My only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. 

I'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.",review,5,4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA

Comfortably situated on Central Avenue slightly south of McDowell, it's a quiet, chic space that I think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months. The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the ""wine by the glass"" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.

The first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  

I most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad.

Windows surround the building to the east and north. You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by, cars and the light rail. The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle. The cheeses are good, though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite, and I haven't heard of most of them before going here. I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company, which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum, and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime.",review,3,9mjItdXixKECanLV6RBIrw

My initial review of 5 stars has not changed.  Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer.   I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there.  It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for.  A full dinner? Sure.  Just dessert? You got it.  A small nosh? Why not.   I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a ""regular"" entree.  It is not to say that they aren't good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu.  

My favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin.  This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list.  Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats.  Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature.  This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off.  The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese.  (Really, any of their mac and cheese options are great).

The food was just as great as the service. We went for restaurant week, so we each did the $30 dealio that comes with three courses. I did the poached pear salad, salmon, and the peach cheesecake.

My cute guy set up a reservation for a Thursday night out. We arrived a little early after he realized Cheuvront would close at 2100. We wanted to be sure to he our cheese and wine fix to the maximum.
I was impressed at the extensive cheese list. I lived in France for two years & this compares very well to a fromagerie in France with all the different cheeses. The staff is all quite nice and knowledgable on the menu of cheeses and wines to pair with. We selected three cheeses and asked to pair with the suggested wines. I was very impressed. The cheese plate is paired with fruits and a scatter of almonds to cleanse the palate between cheeses. My boyfriend ordered the risotto for his entree and he was asked if he wanted salmon or chicken ... It wasn't a small amount of salmon as one would expect
, but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta. Rarely do I finish my entire entree , but this meal was heaven in my mouth. For dessert we shared a piece of hazelnut torte and champagne. Perfect date night and worth the extra workout. The staff is wonderful and the ambience is romantic. The only two things would change is a later closing ...& not to serve dinner while the cheese course is being savoured.

I decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion/recommendation...it was wonderful: creamy, great flavor, not fishy smelling or tasting. Onion rings would have been a great side (hint hint). I wasn't familiar with Kilt Lifter and she gave me a sample with my Hefe. It was so good I had two full glasses. Susie was attentive without being overbearing AND invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia. Good waitress/bartender she is, she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated.

I especially liked the decor - a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of Alice Cooper influence.  The music totally ROCKED.  The restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale. Maybe a bit overpriced but hey! they're in business to make money.

I usually get the BBQ sampler or the incredibly stacked nachos, but tonight I went for the simplicity of the Tom Brady Burger.  It was ""Spot On."" 

The bacon was crisp and plentiful and the burger itself was perfectly cooked with a smoky charbroiled taste.  The fries were fresh, crisp and spiced perfectly.

The beer was available on draft served in nicely chilled her glass. 

Giant screen television monitors are strategically placed throughout the cavernous restaurant so every seat can view the game or games.

There are different vendors that sell food and drinks in the halls past ticketing. The variety depends on the event. You'll find a normal mix of concession stand foods, and if you're lucky, Wendell's Pretzels will have a stand. Alcoholic beverages are normally sold. They are not big on mixed drinks or coffee options, but you're in downtown Phoenix..... Once you walk out you have lots of options, so just have a beer or a coke and bide your time ;) 

Parking is EASY. It's literally surrounded. If you've never been it's easy to get scared when you're driving up because you start to see EVENT PARKING signs blocks away, but fear not! There is plenty of parking directly across the street North and West of the building. You do have to pay for parking, of course, but it's normally no more than you would have had to pay if you'd parked 3 blocks away :)

Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music. 
( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like ""Just Jack"" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  
   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?)

I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us.

Not clogged with bitterness or bottom lines.  Stress?  Sure.  But in the service of something eternal.  The music.  Which lasts when administrations and trends are gone, and flashes in the pan are revealed as pyrite.  Speaking of eternal, the particular piece she was discussing was Beethoven's fifth.  And I learned something!  Real pros don't call it Beethoven's fifth. They call it ""Beethoven Five"".  Can you imagine composing something that the best talents of subsequent ages compete with each other to try to do honor to? She also discussed the ruddy earthy tambre of another piece, and those words resonated because I was careening across a stretch of Arizona's ruddy desert at that point and I felt her words echo the landscape.  She was more lyrical and relevant and hard hitting with her prose than many self-styled prose gurus and 97% of talking heads.

Each wall, of which there are many in this maze of an exhibit has video playing. This means that although there are people wandering through, you'll be able to glance left or right and see the video on another wall. Obviously, the more crowded the museum, the more difficult to see, but it only takes about 30 minutes for the video to complete it's cycle.  You can stay and see the parts you may have missed as it starts over on a continuous loop. 

On exit, you can buy a book and video. I don't recommend the video, it seems to have been shot while the exhibition was open to the public so you have people wandering through the DVD scenes as it's being filmed. It's not so much that they obscure the view, it's just simply too distracting.

but, i had heard so much about it, i like green so much that i jumped at the chance to stop by after a rare 10 a.m. downtown meeting. i got there at about 11:30 and there was plenty of parking (by plenty i mean only three of the lots 10 or so spots were occupied), but, even though i knew what the building looked like from driving past its closed doors so many times before, i still cruised right on past while heading south on 7th st. i went into the second entrance to the lot that wraps behind the building and oops! that's an exit only. i had to do some fancy manuevering and a 3-point-turn (haven't lost my skills since driving test '98 - woot!) to face the right way and get into a spot.

normally, i would be pretty annoyed at all this, but i was too excited to try a refreshing vegetable-heavy wrap on such a damn hot day. and that's a wrap! did not disappoint. while i waited for my companion, i looked over the menu and was surprised at how many of the items were hot or grilled. i was kind of heartbroken until i saw the daily special, chicken salad with avocado, lettuce, veggie mayo in a flavored wrap (all the tortillas are flavored, making the choosing process that much more painstaking).

once i had my order on lockdown, i checked out the art on the walls of this early 1900's house-turned cafe. not my taste (the subjects were robotic kind of monsters with drippy limbs, i thought of pink floyd the wall, while my friend likened it to what a 15 yr old metal head stoner doodles during class) although they had skateboard art, also, which was better. then i picked up a java magazine and flipped through it...basically, if you come alone, you won't look like a loser, there's plenty to keep you busy.

blah blah blah - long story short, the wrap was great, although on sides menu i chose ""house chips"" thinking they would homemade potato chips, but were just store bought tortilla chips. lame. friend got the pasta salad which was much better, i recommend that. plus, they cut the burrito sandwich in half and have bags and plastic wrap right there at the drink station, so you can easily get two meals (hence my being happy at round #2) and i was happy i didn't have to

That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

This place was flippin' good! I mean, gosh darn! How the heck did they just do that? Each bite made whoopee to my taste buds and stayed around afterwards to cuddle! It's not everyday that I find a restaurant that I absolutely want to be a regular at, but La Tolteca is a restaurant that I can see myself having a healthy relationship with, and, if I'm lucky, possibly growing old with. I'm all for market-style restaurants, and La Tolteca seriously nailed it!

Okay, now that that's out of my system, here's what I tried: I tried the chips and salsas, huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles. The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal! Every single bite made me so happy, and even after everyone was full at the table, we still managed to pick away at it until it was completely consumed.

7789,apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ,2,2011-06-22,0,lbGvibtf9lIjPV_48UffIQ,5,"With so many places to eat Mexican food in Phoenix, this is my absolute favorite for Mexican casual dining. The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of ""best in Phoenix"" and they all left agreeing with me.

I confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more ""super"" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.

The carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!

The latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.

Before you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery). Even if you (like me) ordered too much and don't have any room left for sweets, they're just as good as a late-night snack once you get home.",review,2,2U1l902B6fJ9lx77-l6q2w

Given that Yelp never fails, the deceptively named La Tolteca Mexican Foods was presented before us as an attractive option. Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but ""Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."" This place is amazing. 

One of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. 

We looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those). The prices are ridiculously cheap, and the food was amazing, flavorful and truly memorable.

When you see los chonchos eating here, you know it's good.

I always avoid Mexican restaurants because everyone does this slap together something that's so standard and has no flavor unless you get some standard bright red sauce. WELL NO MORE!!

My friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. 
When you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.

I had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalapeños (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with habañero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.

Sin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.

My friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (""ha-MAI-ca"") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! 

Water is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. 
Extra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. 
There's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.

Super Inside Skinny: That's freshly made molé in bags at the grocery counter.

Cool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. 
I usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!

A few years ago my favorite pinata store went out of business and I haven't been able to find a replacement up until recently. I throw lots of parties and love having a pinata for any occasion. When I'm looking for a pinata I usually visit multiple stores looking for something specific. What I find is the same old thing and more often than not- covered in dust. 

When I first walked into Pico Rico I was so please with the selection. Every row I went down I saw something new. There were plenty of varieties so even if it's not for a kids birthday party you'll find something great. Whenever I go back they always have new pinatas I hadn't seen before and something special for whatever holiday is near. The Christmas pinata I bought there was beautiful and unique, I got compliments on it. Their pinatas are very well made. I stuff them with at least 15 lbs. of goodies and they always hold up. On cheaper pinatas the wire will come out when there's too much weight inside.

I've been to Welcome Diner three times in the past two weeks.  I've sampled the lemon ricotta pancakes, the Holy Puerco special and a breakfast biscuit sandwich.  All were delicious, but the Holy Puerco was amazing.  A cheesy grit cake smothered in the most delicious pork I've ever eaten, topped with an egg and house-made pork cracklings, served with flavorful, crunchy potatoes...

I love to sit at the counter.  The crowd is friendly and the WD team is personable and efficient.  There is also plenty of seating outside, as there are only 9 stools at the diner counter.  And since it's in my neighborhood, I can easily walk or bike there.

Food is locally sourced when possible.  I was there yesterday when the guy dropped off the duck eggs.  Most entrees are in the 8-10 dollar range.  They have beer, wine, and limited cocktails.  I highly recommend the Hurricane, with fresh-squeezed juices, light and dark rums, and pomegranate grenadine.  And the new management DOES take credit/debit cards with the square.  You can have your receipt sent to your email or phone number.  I mention this because I saw a couple order who'd never paid with the square before.

Welcome Diner is open for brunch and dinner, but not every day.  I know they close at 3 on Sundays.  They are open Thur. thru Sun.  Oh, and the music is good, too!  Get there and enjoy the patio before the hot weather hits!",review,4,2LCrT_BOJvGV4xi_lmoRcA

If you've answered yes to any of these questions (and we both know you did), you need to get down to The Welcome Diner. The cozy quarters and kitchy decor make it easy to fall in love with, and the staff makes you comfortable enough to stay for hours.
AND THE FOOD! I have yet to try something that didn't make me smile. It's hard to pick a favorite dish but personally, I love the Kiltlifter braised pork biscuit. The carolina mustard sauce that's made in house, is probably the best thing I've ever tasted. And the made from scratch biscuit it comes with, is too good for words. 
Beyond a fantastic, locally driven food concept, they also make one of the greatest cocktails I've ever enjoyed; the Hurricane. And even though you clearly hear the bell dinging from the kitchen and everyone inside scream, ""HURRICANE!"" each time you order one, you just can't seem to figure out how you got so tipsy; they're sneaky little guys.

My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face. I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork.

Welcome Diner is a cute restaurant with plenty of picnic tables outdoors. They do have some indoor seating, but it looks to be quite tiny and every time I've been is in a group. This is the spot for nice, sunny days-I've only been here when it's cool outside so I can't say much about what it'll be like in the summer. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but not so much during the day. Since you're sitting outside, it's allowed for some pretty entertaining people watching.

The brunch here is awesome! I always get super excited when I can have biscuits and gravy (since the only animal I eat is of the fish variety). You can get biscuits with mushroom gravy!! The portion I got was huge and so dang tasty.

It's awesome to be back in the ""south"" and see iced tea on the menu. I kept requesting more, and the cool tattooed chick just brought me out a pitcher, a whole bowl of lemon slices and a smile.  That's hospitality. 

I had the ""KOKO"", a hand breaded, fried chicken breast in a homemade biscuit with some kind of homemade remoulade, baby greens, tomato and a side of vinegar-based red coleslaw. Awesome.

Now it's so much more than that.

Have you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.

My crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of ""flare"" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.

Now let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.

I usually make sure I go on Wednesdays where produce is ridiculously cheap...like 7 kiwi's for a dollar or 9lbs for a dollar watermelon...I'm not gonna lie, I have posted my receipts on the fridge with pride...these are my ""A"" graded school papers of adulthood. The only issue is that when I come home with a trunk full of fresh fruit and veggies that cost me $8 I slowly realize I have to actually store and eventually eat all of the produce I just bought. I hear Thursdays are the days to buy meat for cheap--but my fridge is usually busting with pineapple and strawberries by that point and there isn't room for an ounce of carne asada. 
long story short, be prepared to weave through the masses on Wednesday mornings for some great finds. The rest of the market is fabulous as well. The ""Tradiciones"" restaurant serves excellent--and cheap (shocker) authentic Mexican food. Plus they also have an aisle with cooking supplies (like giant blue pots, tortilla presses, molinillos etc) and a whole wall of spices.

I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.  

Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.",review,0,UMq89piQvpAVFVfiGc6ndA

When I first got my four-legged BFF, I was given a tip that there was a place that had dog gear nearly thirty percent less than the typical stores.

The store is centrally located on McDowell Road, and while the area is not exactly DC Ranch, you are not in the ghetto, and you will be perfectly safe even if you don't own an AR-15.

It is really important to note that Ryan's is set up as an internet order place, NOT as a retail store. This explains why the business does a few things differently than regular retail. Purses/bags either need to be left in your car, or the store will lock them up in the front. I recommend you bring your purse/bag inside, the staff is cool, and they will lock it up for you. While this may be an inconvenience , the price difference will easily make up for any hiccups.

The second tip that will save you time/energy is to know what you wish to purchase, and know how much it will cost. As mentioned before, it is a warehouse, and items are not labeled with price, it's a huge warehouse setup. They have catalogs all over the place to check prices, but my recommendation is to bring your catalog with pages marked of the stuff you want. The staff is super friendly, and will help you with where things are at. It's not always easy to know who works there, but you will figure it out, they're usually pushing metal carts, basically fulfilling online orders by pulling merchandise from the bins.

While you're here, you will find toys, brushes, shampoos, snacks, you name it! The prices are very very good, and you will be happily surprised at the difference between the other guys and Ryan's. Don't miss the kong squeaky toy line, they have fun squeaky toys that are hard to break. Also, the fleecy rope toys are great for dogs teeth, and keep them fresh and so clean clean. Avoid any rope toys, they can break down and when dogs eat them, they can do big time damage to stomach, GI etc.

You can't beat the prices; they are approximately half of what you'd pay at other pet stores.  I am a volunteer puppy raiser, and the pups I raise can only have Kong or Nylabone toys when alone in their crate.  I would go broke buying those anywhere else.  

The staff at Ryan's is really in the warehouse to fill internet orders, but I've always gotten any help I needed from them.  They have all been friendly to me, and I've often been asked if I needed help finding anything.

When you visit, pick up a catalog at the front desk, and leave your purse if you have one.  (You can't bring bags to the back.)  Many of the items on the shelves have prices written on the cartons, but some don't.  And, remember, this is a warehouse...the employees are filling internet orders.  They are not there to tell you prices.  But, trust me, you won't find lower prices anywhere except maybe a yard sale or second hand store.

If you live in AZ but not close to Ryan's, a handy thing to know is that you can order on their website an select ""pick up"".  Then, your order is already pulled for you when you arrive, and you just need to pay for it.

Of course, you can always order online and have it shipped to you.

Indeed.  In my mind I purchased a desk (circa 1930), a walnut platform bed (danish, circa 1960), 2 oversized lamps, and a coffee table that wouldn't fit anywhere in my house.

If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.

Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. 

For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. 

The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.

I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too.

I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. 

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it.

What can be better than brunch/lunch in a quaint historic home adorned with kitschy antiques? Nothing! The answer is nothing.

We went here for a late lunch one Saturday, and it hit the spot. It was perfect. We all fell in love with the adorable house and its wooden floors, unique furniture and abundance of natural daylight. Our server was quite friendly and pleasant, and she let us take our time while also suggesting menu options.

We started with 3 sticky buns - a little rich for me, but very indulgent and sinful. Yum. My husband then moved on to a cheeseburger, which was very tasty. My friend ordered the turkey sandwich, which was bigger than big. I ordered a cup of soup and a half chicken salad sandwich. All of it was very satisfying and super filling. Of course, we couldn't pass on dessert, so we tried the bread pudding. Simply fabulous.

I am dying to go back for brunch...I'd love to try an omelet and mimosa here. I've heard the wait is bad, but we were seated immediately at 1:30pm on a Saturday. After living among the land of the strip mall in North Scottsdale, Coronado Cafe was a much needed and welcome change!

I did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible.  Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service.

While the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first ""real"" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.

We arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.

I ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.
Friend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.

After the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.
20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said ""oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.""
5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.""
5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.

They were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.

Finally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:
Fish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.
Fries: Were best part of the meal.
Tartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.
Coleslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.

Ordered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.

We were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.
He came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.

Finishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.

Maybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.

The best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.

We  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.

30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.

For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma.

We arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.

When I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. 

There've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. 

Then there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. 

Deli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. 

Deli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker ""clean"" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. 

Deli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. 

You can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a ""freegan"" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small ""mom & pop"" businesses, but I have standards & limits.

After that he spent at least 15 minutes trying to clean up the mess by using tons of cotton and acetone. My nails were left incredibly sloppy: polish on the nails was a mess, polish all over my toes, cotton stuck everywhere. Worse, the acetone caused more polish to run onto my toes. I had to go straight to a wedding afterwards, but I removed the polish when I got home that night. What's worse? The shaping of my nails was bizarre.

As this was a few months ago, my brain is clouded on which exact fish (cod or perch) the comments were made about, but as I recall: The waitress claimed that the cod isn't ""fresh"" and she knew I didn't like it, so she offered to get me some perch, which was fresh. That wasn't much better. One (either the cod or the perch) of them tasted, looked like and smelled like a ""fish stick."" It literally looked like a kiddie meal. All in all, I will never return for a fish fry there. The waitress was very attentive and tried to make me happy, but it was not her fault, she did everything she could to please me.

The Atlas Court location appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.

I arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. 

The employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.

When I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could ""saw"" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.

Because of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.

Even more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. 

Returning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was ""f-ing out of here"" because he had ""the longest f-ing day of his life"" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation.

Then came yesterday:

I have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  

So I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  

I continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  

Now, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  

That is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.

Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.

Our entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.

The fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, ""No, I already got this half full bowl.""

A few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.

The food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.

From the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were ""going to need a high chair for that?"" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.

We were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.

She knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.

In this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.

Another server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.

We go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.

At no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.

I'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.

Now, I am an average consumer with a college education, however, I am not familiar with HVAC systems at all. So, I am posting this in the public to hopefully help other consumers to not fall for the ""Spring Tune Up"" Offer by All Comfort Services @ 5245 Voges Road Madison, WI 53718. 

In full transparency I am also posting copies of the quotes & receipts from the technician. Here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111026625881803880071/posts/PKBhrxTNQs7 

Scenario: 
- I found a special on Angieslist for $139 for a technician to come to my house for a spring AC Tune Up. 
- My system is 23 years old, and the furnace has been very well maintained works fine. 
- The technician was at my house for 45 minutes. 

1. Replaced my furnace filter. 
2. Put ""Comfort Services"" stickers all over my furnace (and removed the competitors) 
3. I showed him how to turn on my thermostat (I have a nest) 
4. Hooked up the gauges to the AC and ran the system 6. Stated that I have a very small amount of freon, and that it is cost prohibitive to find a leak ($435-$600, and recharge $161). 
5. Recommended that I buy a new AC unit and furnace 
6. Charged me $139. 
7. Scheduled a Salesman to come to my house 2 business days later to sell me a new A/C & Furnace system for between $7,679 - $8,742. 


Since then, I have had 2 other HVAC companies visit me and make other recommendations and provide a complimentary ""leak check"" by loading in nitrogen and offering me some other options. 


Conclusion: I've decided to recharge the freon in my system through another HVAC company and they will come out in 2 months (free of charge) to test my pressure again. My honest opinion is that All Comfort Services uses their technicians to generate leads to replace full HVAC systems. In the future I will not be using All Comfort Services and taking my business somewhere else.",review,7,NqYwCA-IRPYiaYvXS2Hj-w

The floors were littered with papers, trash and crumbs, the tables and chairs were in disarray and looked like they hadn't been washed or wiped all day.  I've seen junior high school cafeterias right after lunch that were more inviting.  

The sandwiches we ordered were OK.  One was supposed to come with dressing, so I asked for it on the side.  A large, overfed bozo yelled from the back they can't give it on the side - either take it on the sandwich or do without.

When the sandwiches arrived, my dining companion's arrived with a cup of the very same dressing I was told was not available.   When I asked for the one that should have come with my order, Big Bozo yelled it was too late - I already accepted it without.  I showed him the one we were just served, and he yelled back that was all we we're going to get.

You REALLY think this is an efficient way of appeasing abused customers - making them jump through all kinds of ridiculous, impossible website hoops, ifs, and, buts, exclusions, etc. just for a measly $10 discount off $4 worth of cold pizza?  

I'd be impressed if you reported back to me with the corrective actions you took - and then simply mailed me a coupon of substantive value.

Since this incident we've learned just how low Domino's public image has sunk, and the reasons why.  And this flaccid effort at improving Domino's customer relations is typical of Domino's go-to-hell attitude.

I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.

""As a regular you know we have an ""A"" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors.

At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.

Having never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?

This time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor. 

The hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess. 
Curry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing. 

The waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. ""I'll be back"" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie. 
Well waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.   
Then I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced. 
So in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!! 

Anyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.

I was a little baffled when the scheduler told me the next available appointment was not until a few weeks, seeing as I clearly stated I need to get my lump on my breast examined. I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. 

As for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. 

She also gave me ""tips"" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis. I had to laugh at her but she is a NP, she knows what she is talking about...

There were two things that really bothered me about my appointment. The scheduler after my appointment told me she would call me the very next day to let me know the time of my ultrasound at Good Sam. I never heard from her the next day. This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. 

I really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. 

I will NOT go back here again.

When you go into their offices for birth control they basically make you do an exam when you go in.  Well, I needed a new gynecologist and my boyfriend's mom recommended Central Phoenix OB/Gyn.  Since I hadn't gone to a professional before (besides planned parenthood) I thought I would give it a try.  The receptionist is VERY rude.  When we first got there we had to stand at the counter for 15 mins before she came out to give me my paperwork.  Her attitude isn't very welcoming, which is what pushed me away in the beginning.  First impressions are very important.  I had set an appointment with the Doctor, but come to find out that she wasn't in the office and they would have to schedule it with the NP (Nurse Practitioner).  I didn't get an exam like I was told, but she consulted me on my birth control and they took a STD test just so I could feel certain that I didn't have any.  They gave me a small discount for not being able to see the doctor ($185 Without insurance) and told me that they would contact me with the results from my test on Monday (a week from when I went).  Monday came and I got no calls.  I had another appointment scheduled not too far from then, so I decided to wait until I went back to the office.

The second visit I was scheduled with a doctor (that I did see that time) and was greeted by the oh so friendly receptionist.  I was told that they didn't have my test results (They LOST them) and that I would have to do another and they would take care of it.  They DIDN'T do any exam (AGAIN!) even though I was scheduled for it (I haven't had an exam for about 3 years now).  She just consulted me on the birth control and sent me on my way.  I had many questions, I have been having a lot of pain in my lower abdomen which is why I needed to be checked, and she just seemed to be rushing through all of them with no care.  I told her I was frequently urinating and I haven't been drinking a lot of water.  Her solution was that I was drinking a lot of water (I thought I just told her I didn't drink a lot) and that everything was fine.  I was a little frustrated, but that's fine.  I got to the front desk and I had to pay $250 for a consultation and no exam!  They called me a week later and I assumed it was for my results... NOPE.  They had ""forgotten"" to charge me, even though they told me since they screwed up the first time they would take care of it, and I had to pay another $250 for the lab!  That's ridiculous.

There are too many mistakes in this office for anyone to just overpass.

Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.",review,1,KLZ4PABcgoD6TfqGW7vu7A

This is one of the only groceries downtown so I don't understand why they would close early(...10pm I think), and have one lonely cashier working during BUSY times.

Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.

They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?

We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.

I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill.

Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.

We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.

Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.

A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.

He approaches me and says ""Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?""
Me: ""Excuse me?""
BT: ""You're making a mess""
Me: ""I would like to order a drink, not get hassled""
BT: ""I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips""
Me: ""Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment""
BT: ""Are you going to order or not?""

I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.

He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.

He returns with the receipt. On the ""tip"" line I write ""NoFuckingWay!""
I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.

A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.

Yes, I am cut off.

I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.

I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.

Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.

I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.

Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this ""manager"" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.

We ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our bread was more than day-old. I actually had to ask them if it was toasted (it wasn't) because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread. Back it went.

It happened to be right by the Roosevelt where we were actually going to meet up with some of you Yelpers.  You know who you are people.  Hi guys!  It was fun!

We parked and walked up and went inside.  The decor was nice. It seemed to have a decent atmosphere but I am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap.  If a place sucks, I don't care how chic the atmosphere is.  I will call a spade a spade.  

The place wasn't full, quite the opposite really.  Maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied.  So we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which I am fine with but when I ask her if we can wait in inside she says ""No.  Please wait outside.""  What the fuck is that about?  I could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-I'm-cool music they were playing, you could hear crickets chirping in this joint.  Strike one!  So we go outside and wait.  She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus.  They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back.  

She sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything.  So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the month?

The waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!

We order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.  As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet.  So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken.

The waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!

Then comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.  If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales.  But they didn't even save this dish.  I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.  

So in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.  

So now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is ""At least they didn't fuck up the rice"", we are in some ugly territory here people.

It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.

My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).

My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long.  Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive.

The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above).  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.

The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.  Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution.

It seems like the kind of place that you can drop into for a cocktail on a nice Saturday afternoon.  But...

The menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade.  Some people would find that charming, but we found it a bit trying.  Also, it was written on one piece of white paper.  There were NO descriptions of any of the food.  So we had to ask the wait staff about the items we were interested in, which would have been fine, but...

The wait staff.  Hmph. A bit slow.  And totally unknowledgable.  They didn't know what was in the items.  We asked, and then items showed up with things on it that we were not expecting (and didn't like).

The food was NOT GOOD.  I ordered the shawarma.  It was TERRIBLE.  No flavor at all.  The chicken was boiled and had no seasoning.  The tahini sauce had no flavor at all.  I asked for some taztiki sauce to see if it would help.  It did not.  It was the WORST shawarma I have ever had.  However, the potato salad was tasty.

The BF had the lamb gyro which he said was nothing special (very average).  And my friend ordered the italian sandwich, which he liked.  For the price of the food, everything should have tasted better.

Drinks were expensive.  A rum and coke in a place that looks and feels like a dive bar was $7.  SERIOUSLY?  Wow.  Unless you go during happy hour, the prices don't seem worth it.  They did have a good beer selection, and all of those (besides the super cheap ones) were $5 each.  That seemed reasonable.

Finally, the music.  Ugh.  They had this guy with a guitar get up and sing/play.  He was terrible.  And it was SO LOUD we could barely hear each other.

First off, I think everyone in Phoenix is missing the gene where they actually listen to directions.  When you order something, you shouldn't get ANOTHER.  Totally got that, it ruined the start of my vacation and it made me sick the entire time I was in Phoenix.  Ironically, I never stepped into a Baja before, but I learned my lesson to eat dirt rather than eat here.

I ordered a burrito bowl (I think it's called ""bare"" burrito), and I asked for whatever the hell it was, and you have to special order steak or chicken.  I said neither but Iwanted guac.  No problem they told me.  I hate chicken and I got it anyway.  I didn't know until I got back to my conference.  Note to self: they fuck you in the drive-thru.

Anyway, it wasn't even that GOOD.  And it made me sick.  Did I mention that?  I don't totally blame Baja though.  Chipotle did its part in pissing me off for the whole trip.  Baja unfortunately just fell out of my butt hours later.",review,0,b1k4tWoA_ISD7wqu82l8rA

They advertise for window tinting, so my husband and I decided to go in for a quote and possibly schedule a time to do it.

None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. 

We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. 

Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. 

We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a ""few more minutes."" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!

It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. 

As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. 

My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the ""Greek"" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!

I explained my desire to apply for a loan and was directed to a young man named Anthony. 

Anthony could barely muster a friendly attitude. He was visibly annoyed to have to deal with me so close to branch closing hours. Immediately realizing his frustration I apologized for coming in so late and explained that I (like most people) have to work until at least 5pm but was able to get away a few minutes early to take care of some business.

One benefit to his eagerness to be done with me is that he flew through the process. I was literally done by 5:18. At which point his attitude improved significantly.

The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly. 

But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa! 

My other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm! 

I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously. 

It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation. 
It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals! 

So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee's food is much, much better and not as expensive! To Applebee's I'll return but to the HRC, this is my last visit. 

Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback, if I remember the street correctly. The building & bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food.

In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area. 

Before this stop at the HRC, I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well.

Today I had the full order of ribs w/2 sides, coleslaw and sweet potato fries, (75 cents extra) and a beer, total was $30 w/tip.

My coleslaw was pretty good, the fries were crispy but rather bland, (why didn't they season them?). 

But the big problem were the ribs. I have never had ribs that had the consistency of being boiled. That's right, ""boiled"", as in water!  (Or maybe they keep them soaked in water?). Either way they were almost inedible because my idea of ribs should be BBQ'd in a smoker and then I suppose reheated on a flame grill, right? But to be soggy, wet, fatty and without any real smoky flavor? Come on, for what I spent what a terrible value!

By the way I left $1+ change in the tip cup when I placed my order at the counter and got my change but I didn't receive a thank you for it.

Then I asked for some hot sauce or Tabasco to try to make my ribs palatable and they just ignored me. I could understand if I was rude or complaining but I was wasn't at all.

Finally when we were able to place a order the extremely rude cashier seemed so irritated that we actually had the nerve to enter this place that she had no desire to even take our order or answer any questions that we had. The price was decent but on the expensive side, 20 dollars for 2 people without drinks. So we finally get our order and knowing that i have to check my bag because i read the sign that had it printed in BOLD letters, I noticed that I was missing my potato salad. So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times.

When we went back to check the status, the response was ""oops, sorry your information was not transferred from the iPad"" (apparently there was some type of technology glitch).  The response was then that we would be next, so let the wait begin some more.  When our pager did activate, we were given an option to have a view (which would require an additional wait) or be seated immediately.  We stated we would like a view but as we had now been waiting for nearly an hour didn't want to have another unreasonable wait for the view.  Apparently that response translated into ""seat these 2 in the darkest corner of the restaurant with absolutely no chance of even a glimpse of the field"".   After we were seated and realized that we could now be sitting inside any other TGIFridays (surrounded by solid red walls) the other guest in my party then returned to the hostess stand to inquire if maybe a better table with a view was coming available as we were celebrating a birthday (we did not use this line to play on sympathies, it was a birthday occasion - not that it mattered because there were no sympathies).  The hostess then said she would come find us and knew where we were currently seated, only to never be seen or heard from again.  The unapologetic attitude, the unwillingness to make reparations for an obvious oversight and error on the staff's part, and the poor food quality have me hoping this place closes their doors as so many other TGIFridays across the Valley already have and will hopefully be reopened by a restaurateur that knows customer service, food quality, and overall restaurant management (my vote - Four Peaks!).

She said it costs them extra for the meat so it was only fair to charge us extra. So, I kindly paid an extra 2.50 to get a machaca and chicken taco in my combo and continued the order. I asked for mild salsa with one pair of tacos and was told ""we have red and green and everyone will get both"". 4 of us ordered a total of 8 tacos, 1 combination plate, and an order of chips and salsa. Total sale was around 33 bucks.  

I get back to the office and hand out the food and this is when we realized that we got CHIPS AND HOT SAUCE, not Chips and Salsa which was a very unpleasant surprise. Many of the chips were chewy and soggy and we threw most of the bag away because of this. I expected white meat in my 3.00 chicken tacos but received dark, greasy meat. I thought a family restaurant will always provide quality meat?? The machaca was so overloaded with grease that the lettuce turned gray and slimy and the hard taco turned soft and mushy. I literally had to POUR the grease out. The chicken was flavorless and we didn't get cheese on any of the tacos. Let me guess, only fair they charge extra for cheese?? 

Not all of our tacos were as bad as mine but we all expected better flavor, cheese on our tacos, white-meat chicken, the ability to mix and match taco choices, and salsa with our chips; after all, a family restaurant will always be better quality than a franchise, RIGHT? The beans and rice were pretty good and while I do like my hot sauce hot I feel they substitute flavor with spice. 

All in all, I give Rosita's Place 3 out of 1000 stars (for the rice and beans and that's sad). I also found it offensive and absurd that they would openly slam on franchise restaurants when a Filiberto's or Chipotle taco blows the doors off of Rosita's Place. All of us agreed that this place would be at the bottom of the list come time to choose a winner. This is obviously not saying any other entree they have is just as bad; I'm only discussing their tacos. I was waiting all week to get some good tacos and am highly disappointed. It's safe to say I will never go to this restaurant again.",review,1,0SU1oBnMlqgMVuRs2mb9wA

Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles, and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor. The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a ""party"" motel. And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint? I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit. He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $150.00 cleaning deposit if we smoked. Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke. LoL....  And nobody in my family smokes. I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said, ""Well, looks like we came to the right place honey""'

I was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building. I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black. Old gum, some kind of splash stains, trash, all in view on the way to the room.  Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up. They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded? 

One of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered. I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out. I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm. I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant. She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes. I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation. We went back and hung out in our other room. DISGUSTING. The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint, dust, and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed.  Stains on the carpet and chair seating area. There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time.  When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex? Seriously?  After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom. Gross. I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can. We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed. 

After an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised. I went back to the front office for some coffee. The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room. And that it had aired out pretty good. I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here. After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them, and the condition of the room, I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go.  So I did. I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into. And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues. 

Later that night after two of my kids showered. their tub (in room 108, the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain. I walked back to the front office and met the lady again. She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already. I now asked for a new room. She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room. I never heard back from them the entire stay. Not to see if we were ok? Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)?  

The next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast. Ok at least they are trying I guess. But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you. He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people. 

We will never stay her again. And I feel like we should get a partial refund. I understand things happen. But this place is a joke. I would be embarrassed to work here. And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on. Just hard to believe people can just not care.

Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  Right?

So we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.

You are not gonna believe this, I'm still in shock. Worst interaction with any employee ever. 
My mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.
We got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)
When I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.
(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; ""maybe you should learn how to say no."" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said ""Maybe you should mind your own business."" Then I turned around again and heard; ""maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick."" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said ""do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.""
He looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said ""No."" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. 
I explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!
I've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said ""you don't have to explain that to me..."" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said ""well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. ""
When I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???
So I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.
I was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.

Had my Kindle STOLEN from their mailroom.  Amazon replaced it, but the office initially wasn't helpful in trying to find it, or admitting that it was even their fault.  In fact the property manager got snarky with me and stated they are not responsible for any lost or stolen mail.  Gee thanks, so I guess that means you can't help me look for it either.  As proof I offered up the fact that UPS had a signature on file for the delivery from the office manager.  I even called and talked to the guy who delivered it and he remembered dropping it off b/c it was one of those black Kindle boxes.  

After all was said and done they said they'd leave the door to the mail room close and lock it.  I went in this past weekend, saw the mail room door wide open with not a person in sight.  Again, it's impressive how incompetent these people are.

Initial review August 2013

They can't get their act together.  Moved in in May and there were many issues with the apartment (dishwasher had rusty wracks, ice maker didn't work, carpets were not properly cleaned, dryer timer didn't work, the disposal was broken, the garage door open was broken, etc.).  It took several rounds of complaining to even get them to come out and look and even more rounds of follow up to get them to complete it.  It's September and the ice maker is STILL broken.  It's incredible how terrible they are!  I am actually astounded they could be this bad at their jobs.  I am ticked off enough that I logged on to write a bad review and I am typically a very understand and sympathetic person, but this is ridiculous.  We were also welcomed to a nice ANT problem the day we moved in.  I had called several weeks before we moved in and asked them to spray for critters.  Obviously that never happened either.

I also didn't appreciate the fact that they list GARAGE space in their square footage stats.  Something they LIED (intentionally or no, they should know what the square footage is in their units... that makes them either liars or incompetent and you should not tolerate either) about to my wife before we leased it and didn't discover until after it was too late (I had to move in sight unseen because we relocated from across the country and my wife was the only one who could see it in person at the time).

I've also had to call the cops for a domestic disturbance for someone in the complex... you can't always help or predict that, but it's the first time I've ever had to do that and I lived in downtown Chicago for 6 years before I moved here.

So we've lived here for the better part of a year now and since day one we have seen these little yellow roaches everywhere that seemed to come out at night, they were EVERYWHERE! We don't have much food in the house and its all kept in the fridge to keep it from all the bugs. They come from the unsealed cabinets and every drain in the house. I even see them in the dishwasher climbing all over the dishes all the time. Dishes pulled from the cabinets often had bug crap on them. I don't know how many times I woken up to bugs crawling around, flicked them off my newborn son or woken up to them in my shirt.  We literally kill anywhere from 15-40 roaches in a single night every single night. When we go to the office they always off put it onto other people and though we see the spray truck here regularly but never visiting out unit, only those near the office.The last 5 months or so seem to have brought some new beetle things to the apartment. Twice I've moved stacks of papers for work and tons of baby beetles fleeing from them. And for the record we are immaculate in our place. Theres never a mess or uncleaned surface. 

The grounds are very poorly kept in places beyond the front office area. The gates here have worked for more than a week at most at one time. They actually haven't closed in months, last time they were fixed it was for just part of the day.  The garbage piles up around all the garbage cans for days. You will find bags lying everywhere including taking up car spaces which are not always easy to come by. 

The water in the apartments get turned off randomly without any warning. Its happened a few times during our stay here but the last time the grounds were flooded so I could see it wasn't planned. 

The air conditioning unit in here drips a lot and my family and I have had bad respiratory issues the last 6 months and come to find out the AC was pumping out mold spores that we were breathing for months. The thing hadn't even had the air filter in it all this time either. All those times we thought it was severe allergies or that we stayed awake all night coughing was poor building maintenance. My infant son often gets fevers of up to 104 that seem to spike when all of our symptoms get going. Needless to say we are breaking our lease and moving. I will not pay a company to let me rent a bug infested mold box that jeopardizes the health of my family. 

Your neighbors will break the rules in the lease agreement at every turn. They invite parties of several people to the pool and blast music all day (and night) long. Screaming kids at the pool after midnight got old real quick. I very regularly see children under the age of I'm guessing 12 at the pool unsupervised with no adults to be found.",review,0,vtKVMmio9N5fdTzRxno_aA

Generally I would say I have been pleased with living here but the longer I have stayed the more learn and the more I want to move out. 

Things I learned after moving in or since: the store owner of the internal 'market' was murdered a couple years back by a tenant.  Within he last year a female tentant was raped mid-day by two indivuals, two different instances of tenants dying from drug overdose, 11 first floor apartments were broken into in a month and had their flat screen tv stolen

A friend of mine had his computer stolen from his car while parked right in front of a security camera. The front office has not been helpful or concerned about this. Their initial response was that 15 new residents were moving in and they would not get to the tapes... a couple days later they stated corporate would have to review the tapes. It has now been almost three weeks and they still have not contacted me regarding any of this.. I realize theft is a problem every where.. but they clearly don't care about my concerns. 

Other (Non-safety) issues: 

Pool maintenance.. The pool near my unit was shutdown by the city for the majority of the year last year. All winter the pool was shut down the the point ducks moved in..then in the peak of pool season they finally drained it to re-tile and make repairs.. but the time it was open again pool season was nearly over. Other pools are frequently dirty, without operable chairs, or the key to enter has been changed. 

Lights: Many of the lights around the complex are burned out or broken.. The light by my unit is out, it was replaced a couple months back and burned out almost immediately.. I am specifically not calling to report it to see how long it takes for a repair. 

Cleanliness: Many of the tenants, (myself included) have dogs. There have been periods of time where everywhere I look there seems to be dog poop and all the bags to pick it up are gone. I have also noticed a lot of the tenants toss chicken bones into the grass and bushed around the grills. I have seen trash/dead birds/grass clippings/vomitt left for days at a time.

Applebees is typically our ideal location for nights we plan out, due to their awesome happy hour. We usually go to one particular location but on occasion we will go to this one (44st and Thomas). I've been to this location maybe 8 times. Every single time, we leave incredibly dissatisfied. The food is cold or tastes old. The drinks are always watered down.

The last time we went was a few weeks ago. My boyfriend had just got off work and wanted to have some drinks after a long day. We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks. Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.

I ordered the nachos. Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce. How hard is it to get nachos wrong? My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta. To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer. The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it. By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer. 

Finally our food arrived. The nachos looked great, as did his food. However, looks can be deceiving. Everything about the nachos was disgusting. The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around. The chips tasted old and stale. My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small. And the chicken pasta was cold as well.

The waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive. I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better. When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips. The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable. She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me.

We sat in the dining area and our waiter asked us our drinks (pink lemonade and raspberry iced tea) and then we get chips and salsa with watered down salsa  then the waiter comes about 10 mins later brings drinks (sprite/almost clear watered down raspberry iced tea) then he was helping the table next to us so after I call him and he kept on walking (maybe he didn't hear me) until the second time he came back and I got his attention then I order a coke instead and he takes our order. I ordered the mini chimies. 15 mins later I was greeted with dark brown on a plate and looked like they were fried in 10 day old dirty cooking oil or even possibly ""refried"" (wouldn't surprise me with all the watered down stuff) so because i had other stuff to do I decided not to complain and attempt to eat what they had given me and there are 6 which I ate 3 and I was tapped out on burnt grease...so he gives ME the bill which he watches me pull out my card and pay but when he comes back he hands my card and receipt to my guest.

I ordered flowers online to be delivered on Saturday 2/11 for a friend's mom for her birthday.  They delivered without the personalized card.  My order confirmation clearly shows the message I had written for her.  She had to call Cactus Flowers twice to figure out who they were from and the employee she spoke to was incredibly rude to her.   Also the flowers did not look like what I had ordered.  In the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely.  I called Cactus Flowers the next day, Sunday to try and figure out what happened.  Even though I had my order number, it still took her 10 minutes to find my order.  Apparently the flowers had come out of their Carefree location so if I wanted them to deliver a new bouquet, she would call that location to make sure they had all the flowers that were supposed to be in it.  She said she would call me back and let me know.  I had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail.  It took me until THursday to get back in touch with them due to my work schedule and the fact that....wait for it.....they have no voicemail.  What kind of business operates with no way for anyone to leave them a message?

So on Thursday I finally reached them and spoke to someone else and she told me that they would redeliver Friday or Saturday.  Guess what, it didn't happen!  I called back yesterday and spoke to someone who was less than pleasant and she said she would have a manager call me back today.  It is now 3:00 and I haven't heard from anyone.  I'm sure I will have to call them back, again.  I don't think I have ever experienced such crappy customer service.  It actually takes effort to suck as much as they do.

I made an order to have flowers delivered to my wife's work on Valentine's day. I looked at the exotic flower arrangements that Cactus Flower Florists carried. And I found one I knew my wife would love. They were a ""Birds of Paradise"" arrangement, we have just moved from Hawaii to Arizona and I thought it would be a great choice. I ordered and purchased the flowers and made sure that they would be able to be delivered by Feb. 14th Valentine's day. Well the day finally comes and my wife never gets the arrangements and when I call the florist to inquiry about the delivery a female employee, who I am later told name is Laura, tells me that the date of delivery was for Feb. 15th, now if I did not see that the flowers would have been delivered on valentine's day why would I schedule it for the day after, it kind of defeats the purpose, I would have looked somewhere else or just picked some up myself. Anyway she goes on to tell me they will not make any more deliveries that day. So I end the call now expecting them to deliver the arrangement on the 15th. Again the 15th is here and still by 330 p.m. my wife still has not received the flowers. I again call and ask about the delivery, after being transferred 3 times was told that on their system was a note saying that they had called me twice and left two messages (I never gotten any calls by them) that they did not have the birds of paradise flower and needed to have it replaced, this note was said by them to have been put in the system on the day I ordered the flowers. So not only did they say they called which they did not, but when I actually called them and spoke to a represenative nothing was told to me about this, nothing was ever mentioned about not having the flowers I ordered. Frustrated at the whole ordeal wanted it to be done with I agreed to let them send another ""exotic"" arrangement in its place. What my wife received that day was as pitiful arrangement as I have ever seen, not worth the over hundred dollars I spent. I could have pulled weeds out of my yard that were nicer!

There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.

I am currently in the market for a new mountain bike.  I've done my research, talked to friends who are bike enthusiasts, and I've looked around a few places.  Really, all I needed from Slippery Pig was to get my frame size double checked, and to answer a few questions about some subtle differences between different equipment setups between Cannondale models.  If they had provided those answers, they would have made a sale.

In the past 4 weeks, I stopped by the shop 3 times.  All 3 times, my entry, browsing, and lingering presence went unnoticed.  I was ignored when the shop was somewhat busy (acceptable), but also when there was only one other customer.

I understand that the guys can get busy, or can be distracted, etc.  But how hard is it to get a simple acknowledgment or something like ""Hey, we'll be with you as soon as we can""?  I've gotten more acknowledgment of my presence from strangers in a stadium men's room waiting line than I did from the staff at Slippery Pig.  How hard is it to at least give me a head nod, or even look in my direction?  Actually, I take that back.... I watched them all look at me, but then not say anything.  I even got acknowledged by another customer as I fiddled with price tags, but nothing from the sales guy standing between us both.  Unbelievable.

Well, needless to say, I will not be spending my hard-earned money there.  I wish I could opine like other yelpers about their aloof attitudes, or their knowledgeability, or service.  Sadly, I can't because Slippery Pig never had me at hello.

I drove here not expecting much (always known this location as the crappy one), I had been to this location while it was still under the forgotten step-child The Eggery.  I was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to The Good Egg (not sure if this is recent or not, I haven't been down this part of Camelback in a bit of time).  Upon seeing the new signage, I thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no, nope, not at all.

I met my party that was already seated in the WAAAAAAY outdated restaurant... I mean seriously people, the bakery cases that haven't been used in decades, the wood, the wallpaper, the metal chairs, and all the BRASS... oh my goodness all the brass....YUCK!..... Give this place a little attention Good Egg.

When I sat down I found half of the table wet and no napkins, a little puzzled I asked what the deal was.  Apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... I repeat TRY to clean it up, he didn't succeed. Perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up, but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before I got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  Nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy, nice.

After being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if I wanted anything to drink... Coffee and cream please. And walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... Now I am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in, so friends were huunnngggry.....He comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best), no cream, and walks away...AGAIN.  We sit, and sit, and sit.  He finally comes and ask if we are ready to order, umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah, I think we've got it.   We order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.

He comes back with cream, no napkins.  sigh.

Food finally comes, order is right, but haphazardly prepared.  Maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?  

I have the Monterrey, it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown, my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing, the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. Dollar Pancakes were shaped like road kill, and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  That's no big deal, I don't care.  But as I am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew, don't touch my food once it has hit the table.  I worked my way through high school and college waiting tables, I have a high tolerance for eew, but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  Dude, if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen, ignorance is bliss, but if you do it in front of me once the food is ON THE TABLE for goodness sake then that shit just be NASTY yo!  I know damn well there is a good chance your hands aren't clean.  Practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people, its true.

Friend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  Friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  It was dry, and lacking in well... turkey! It looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  Her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing I had ever seen.  What was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? Check your cold storage bins people!  If Friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of Friend 2 then I wouldn't be writing this review right now because I would be supporting Friend 1 in the HOSPITAL!! Friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens, but how does a STRAWBERRY get put on a TURKEY sandwich and the cook doesn't notice?!??!!!

We could of said something if our server wasn't practicing his disappearing act again. Only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check, and kindly paused out of his busy day to say ""Everything ok?"" ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no ""thank you"" ""have a good day"" ""come again"" ""bugger off"" nothing....  Mind you I use the word ""busy"" lightly, there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am, and at least 4 other servers that I saw.

even though they had me in their system they could not find my ""chart"" so they decided to charge me new patient prices...even though i was clearly a patient previously. i had spent lots of time on the phone with the finance lady (like a car dealer, odd) telling her exactly what i was coming in for so financially i knew what to expect.... because last time i recieved and $800 bill, yup thats right....$800!!!!! seemed a little excessive for a pap and routine labs...they sure like taking advantage of the cash pay people which is sad especially since i'm sure they do their fair share of ripping off insurance companies. anyway, i was told to come in early for appointment, i wound up waiting over an hour in the waiting room, no one would acknowledge me so i finally asked when they could see me. they soooo so rudely brought me in back to the room. i saw the super rude grumpy nurse practitioner who treated me like i was an airhead. and instead of addressing my issues i was there for she went right into wanting to do bloodwork, cholesterol screening, mammogram, and told me i probably have a pituitary tumor!!!!!! WTF!!! who does that?? she hadnt even done a routine exam at that point. and then told me i didnt know what i was talking about. such a rude rude rude woman. they more interested in doing more labs to make money than anything. so after my horrible experience with that hag i had to deal with the car dealer finance lady who decided to then charge me new patient prices which is more than existing and more than what was agreed upon on the phone. they new and admitted they told me one thing and then made me pay another . they really are rotten people and i hate when people get into any kind of health care knowing people are ailing but they dont have the temperment to deal with it long term so they walk around like a bunch of grumpy sourpusses in the office and make patients coming in with issues feel like we're a burden! isn't that what they signed up for??? try to be a little kinder rude ladies, its probably because they're all hitting menopause in there right now",review,3,tDnhgDLVZsfv7phsw0SWlA

I went ahead and got the deep cleaning as it had been a while since my last cleaning. I was skeptical of the other recommendations though, so I drove across the valley to my trustworthy dentist for a second opinion.

On top of that, the office at Weldon looked poorly maintained, with dusty looking countertops and such.
Also, I just got a bill that shows I was charged $55 for ""Oral hygiene instruction"" - which I was NEVER made aware of the fact that I was receiving, or would be charged for, and I was never asked if I wanted it.

We have the large 2 bedroom and it doesn't feel cramped like most apartments. The location is close to a light rail stop (Central & Indian School) and across the street from Steele Indian Park which holds a lot of great local events & even has a dog park. Great pools and the gym is ok. 

Now with the bad. The management here is completely unhelpful. They actually changed management a few months ago but from what I have experienced they are no more helpful than the last. 

The previous management never did an actual walk-through with us, just had us fill out the form and drop it off. They never gave us the key to our patio storage and we still do not have it (we tried 2-3 times to inquire and just gave up after that). They would take weeks to complete maintenance orders (simple or complicated), obviously a sign of bad management. It even took them months to get us copies of the gate keys.

Right as they switched over management there was for some reason a large pool of white paint in one of the parking garage spots. My toddler almost slipped in it, getting paint all over herself and I. I spoke to someone now under the new management and they said they would look into it. Who knows if they did. 

It seems they've tried to employ ""fun"" things with iliveheretoo.com and a meet & greet with management staff. I feel as though they should have improved their basic customer service and maintenance before even thinking about those things. They sent out a letter for Fourth of July stating that they would be providing security for our parking garage and to ensure no reserved spots would be taken by event attendees. The park holds a large fireworks event, so there is a lot of traffic. Well as we pull in we see the hired security and think ""Awesome!"" but we pull in to our space and there is someone in it! So I don't know what kind of process the management relayed to this hired security but it was obviously not thought through. The security let us know that they could tow, but we would need the tow card--which they ALSO NEVER GAVE US. They also promised the top floor of the garage would be reserved and blocked off for residents to bring chairs and watch the show. They didn't come through on that either. There were tons of cars parked and even more that were still trying to drive through the loads of pedestrians (including children) making it very dangerous. 

They scheduled the apartment above me to be turned over on an early Saturday morning with the banging and noise continuing well on into the afternoon. After calling in and asking why they would do this on a weekend the explanation was ""well if they don't do it today the people can't move in."" Which to my reaction is great, what about the people who pay and already live here?! You mean to tell me they couldn't schedule themselves correctly and move it 2 days to a Monday? Another mis-management of their maintenance scheduling. 

Other issues include overflowing garbage that's right inside the garage,  pigeon/cat/dog waste, big security gate breaks often (defeating the 'security') part. When it rains you can just smell all the dog and cat pee. I love animals--but they should really work on controlling this issue. They could probably benefit from working with a shelter or a trap-neuter-return organization for all the stray cats. They could also pay more attention to which residents are not cleaning up after their pets. There are several areas in the complex and in the garage as well that are caked with pigeon feces. 

I know this is long and I probably sounds like a grump, but just don't want anyone to be sold alone on the units aesthetics like I was. I think ""The Station"" just down the street might be owned by the same company? I've been there and its SO much cleaner and nice--but I think that's because they cater to a higher price point, sadly.

Parking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood.

The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.

He stopped eating it and pushed it aside as well and I had to ask him if his was as bad as mine was.  We both got it and neither of us could literally ""choke it down."" The noodles were mush and the entire Lasagna had been obviously pre-cooked and microwaved. Costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree.  We basically asked the ""manager"" if anyone was looking at the items coming out of the kitchen because it simply shouldn't have been served.

That speaks VOLUMES about what kind of customer service is to be expected. This is the WORST dry cleaner I have ever gone to, bar none. Three times now I have paid top dollar to have Betsey Johnson dresses cleaned, only to have them returned looking exactly the same as when I dropped them off. Before last week, the last dress I had brought in (which cost me $12.00 on eBay, and that included shipping) cost me $22.00, $11.00 for the dress itself, & $11.00 for the polyester under-slip. There was a spot on the dress when I brought it in which was still there when I picked it up, however, since there was no notification that the spot couldn't be removed, I thought I was going home with a clean dress--as was the case with both other dresses. Btw, DANA argued with me and implied that I am a liar because I said that none of the three items had a tag on them indicating there was a spot that couldn't be removed. Because I had already had two experiences in the past with spots that weren't spot-cleaned, I decided to try hand washing the third dress before donating it to Goodwill...lo & behold, the spot came out. Customers get sick of going back, wasting PRECIOUS time & more money to get things done right, which was why I decided not to bring that particular dress back in. Last week I decided to give them one more chance, so I brought in three dresses to be pressed & one sleeveless gauze top. One of the dresses has layers, but I was not advised when I dropped it off that pressing it would cost $17.00. The other two dresses evidently cost $11.00 apiece to press, & the gauze top about $7.00. At that time, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED for the price to press long dresses, & the clerk, Mayra, told me it would cost about a dollar less than the dry cleaning process. She did not mention A THING about the layered dress costing $6.00 more...evidently I was supposed to intuitively know that the question needed to be asked. In other words, A LIE BY OMISSION. So I spent around $46.00 for the pressing of three dresses & the dry cleaning of one cotton top. I had asked for an $11.00 discount on the current order based on the fact that they didn't do the job right on the last dress I had brought in, & the owner, DANA (DANA wanted me to be sure to mention DANA's name here...happy to oblige!) started shaking and hyperventilating because I told DANA I thought a discount was in order for the inconvenience, as well as the spot that was still present on the last dress after I got it home...which cost me $11.00. I don't think even wealthy people--which I am not--feel they have money like that to blow. I asked DANA what was WRONG with DANA, treating a customer this way, & DANA's response was that DANA is the owner & that DANA can treat me however DANA likes. Man, do I pity DANA's employees. I wasn't asking for an additional $11.00 refund for the extra charge to clean a SLIP. Anyway, evidently DANA would rather make herself sick than be kind/accommodating to a customer. In the two years I was their customer, I had asked twice to have spots re-cleaned, NOT FOR REFUNDS OR CREDITS, yet today DANA basically told me I am a malcontent because I don't like to spend tons of money for nothing. And then DANA said I complained EVERY TIME I picked something up...so DANA is a LIAR, too. Believe me, if I had had that many complaints prior to today, I would have stopped bringing my clothes there a long time ago...today's experience was the FOURTH strike, which is more chances than I give most people who take my money, do a substandard job & then try to blame me instead of doing the right thing by admitting they made a mistake. SPARE ME. And yes, I consider the way DANA treated me--& the job FASHION CLEANERS did--a form of r@pe, because unless I paid their price, I was powerless to get back what is mine (which didn't bother me so much until I paid them $22.00 FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING). DANA's complete lack of customer service--& outright RUDENESS to a customer who, in the past, had referred OTHER people to spend their money at Fashion Cleaners--ensured that I won't go back. DANA actually accused ME of being defensive!!!! The girl who waited on me, Mayra, admitted when I left that I had always been very kind in the past, until DANA had a total meltdown today--obviously DANA doesn't know HOW to take criticism. My advice to DANA:  If DANA can't stand the heat, DANA should get shrunk and out of the freakin' kitchen. DANA does not belong in a customer-service oriented profession. PATHETIC. Three strikes, and I gave them the GIFT of another. YOU'RE OUT!

This place has decent ambience. That's about it. The restaurant staff that I encountered was non-friendly, non-welcomy, and probably non-existent!

The biggest offense is the food! I cannot believe so many other reviews were soooo positive. I came in a little late (9:15 p.m.) and that may have rubbed the waiting staff wrong, but there were 2 other parties that came in after me.

Going back to the food. I ordered Miso Ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork), and a side of Agedashi Tofu. 
1. The Miso ramen came with a slice of salmon.  Really? Salmon??? It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso?? There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.  

2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get? A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce? Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!

3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.  The guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water!

I also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table.  I know it is sealed but, really??? in front of customers?

This place really cut corners in terms of food and service. 

Benefit of doubt? Maybe, since I tried this place only once, but once is enough for me. I saw 2 sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself. Not impressed at all.

As promised we came back to your dealership last night. Your New Car Manager, PAUL GLANS"" was very rude with us using the old scum bag CAR SALES tactics claiming he lost the key to the White Diamond 2013 Escalade Platinum which I spent over 2 hours previewing earlier in the afternoon. You were aware we were coming back last night? YOU AND THIS SCUM BAG waisted our time? I told you that my wife was a CFO and conducting Board meetings all week and we had a short window to buy the 2013 Escalade Platinum. We even called you to ask you to pull the auto out while headed there so my wife could see the auto which you agreed to do? PAUL GLANS (THE SCUM BAG) was insisting to walk around our ""trade in"" 2011 BMW 550i in advance to even showing my wife the 2013 Escalade Platinum?  Uhhh... this is 2013 not 1980? Flash-back??? I gave you guys the info on the trade earlier in the day including a pay off amount. This is horrible business. You and PAUL GLANS were cherry picking us which is a form of discrimination! EVERYONE READ THIS! This happens to be Coulter Cadillac, you and PAUL GLANS problem, not ours, as we immediately called Mike at LUND Cadillac who has inegtity and merrit and is dropped off a Platinum Escalade ESV Black Ice to our house the next morning.

We also suggest PAUL GLANS crawl back into the hole he crawled out of as we are headed to all the online reporting sites to share this horrible experience with the Universe. PAUL, you can't discriminate, cherry pick and treat customers like this.  Question? Does the owner of Coulter Cadillac even know that PAUL GLANS treated us like this or is that scum bags trying to sweep it under the rug as if nothing happened? One thing is for sure, the owners WILL read about it. Go to your BBB page. Thank you, Valued Customer

The soup was also cold.

Chopped liver tasted like liver... ""Livery"". At better delis, the chopped liver is smooth and creamy-- slightly sweet. This was bitter and not smooth. Unpleasant.

With that, I'm already out of things I like, so I suggest you spend no more than that here and leave.   

I only went to meet friends, and a good friend at that.  I would have passed any other time.   

I order a Stella on draught, served right, even in the Stella glass.  They do know how to serve beer and other alcoholic drinks here, like, in the strictest sense of being able to pour a non-skunked brew or a strong cocktail in the right glass.   Not much else, unfortunately.

$4.75, the bartender tells me.  I hand him my Visa.  

""It's cash only.""   

My vision blurs as I strain to quell my irritation as we're already off to a great start.  I should have left right there, but that would have probably been illegal and the Stella looked pretty good.  

I take out a $20 from the ATM, the last ATM in Arizona that still dials out. So I spent my time waiting looking for skimmers because nobody else would have noticed one in a place this cheap.   

I like paying $5 in fees for a $5.75 beer.   I really do.   (With tip, as its not his fault his job sucks.)

As I find out, I pulled the last $20 out of the ATM before it *ran out of money.*  If I intended on pulling more out to lessen the 25% tax on my cash, I would've been doubly irritated.  

So when the bartender switches the policy from ""cash only"" to ""we take plastic"" after I just went out of my way and money to comply...I didn't know there was another reason I don't want to go back but the morons who run this place figured one out.  

The stale-beer-and-sweat smell was getting to me by the time my friend needed a cigarette.   But forget seeking your respite on their ""patio.""    

Their ""patio"" is more like a planemullkip, a word I had to just make up from the German translation for ""a tarp stretched over a garbage dump.""  

No prior English word better describes this pathetic joke--It smells worse outside, there's no furniture, but there is plenty of garbage and you can't even take your drink out.

Maybe it's intentional--they've duplicated being just as cheap, annoying, and lazy on the outside as they have inside.   The tiny bathroom that forces everyone to watch you take a dump is just like the rest of the place:  all the charm and appeal of a rural county lock-up, right down to the same suicide-proof sheet-metal toilet.  Even if you get off on this sort of thing despite the many inherent travesties, go elsewhere.  

Incidentally, I really like setting my coaster on top of my drink and adjusting it so just in case one of the creepy trolls here GHB's my drink, I'll notice.

A use permit is something like $500 from the city for outdoor alcohol  consumption, and they might pay that much in fencing.   Instead, I just I don't get it.  I first went here 7 years ago and I can tell they've made about $300 in capital improvements since then, all from Goodwill.

Outside lives a $30 heater, they have a $150 website, and $100 for a used LCD or two.   One of the LCDs was displaying a completely different faded illegible picture than the one on the same channel next to it, putting the rampant cheapness here in striking contrast to the one new thing that worked--the jukebox probably wasn't theirs and didn't work either.   Who even knew you could get a website from Goodwill?

The last $20 they must have spent is for the annoying plastic flaps they hang on the back door to lessen their AC bills.
 
This place reeks of cheap.  And not in a good way like a cheap beer, the sort of thing I'll tolerate a lot for.  

Roscoe's is cheap like ""you've got to be kidding me"" cheap or ""the smell just made me throw up in my mouth"" cheap, both of which negate any benefit of cheap beer. 

Rocoe's survives on two things:  being the one gay sportsbar in town and being the one thing to do on a Tuesday night.   

So I give it a 2 out of 10.  It covers its bases, but that's it.   I'll say it a third time.

We were not the only people that came in that night trying to use our certificate, the table next to us also had one. We went in that night because of the certificate - some people get them to try a new place - i got it cause i needed a little extra incentive to go back to CDT - I remembered the food being good but a bit pricy - $25 off seemed like a nice discount. Whatever, the reason, restaurants count on sites such as restaurants.com to bring in people to their establishments. We upheld our end of the agreement - we went in, ordered more  than just the 2 entree min (app, salad, corakge fee) but CDT did not uphold their end of the agreement - and in my opnion, that is horrible customer service. The certificate was supposed  to be good for a year - it's not like we tried  to use it close to the expiration date, I tried using it one month after purchasing it.

For their price points, the food should be a lot better and the tables shouldn't be so close to each other. Their food reminded me of the kind of food I can get from the Whole Foods deli. After Valentine's Day here, I felt taken advantage of by the restaurant. $100 PER PERSON for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option, with no choice of anything else. Had the menu been priced at around $40 a person, I still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced. 

- Brie Brulee: A name far more interesting than the dish itself. It's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit. There was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it, so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish. 
- Onion Tarte: Probably the tastiest thing all night, but again, not worth the money. It has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust.
- Salad: Greens, fruit, nuts, and too much dressing. It was fine but not worth $25.
- Chestnut Soup: Didn't taste a thing like chestnuts. The taste is actually like an Indian lentil soup called Sambar. 
- Filet Mignon: My boyfriend seemed to like it. The mashed potatoes it was served with were very good. The other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil.
- Lamb Shank: The couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting, like no one even took the time to season them.
- Cherry Tart: This was yummy, and fortunately didn't taste much like cherry. The shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic.
- Chocolate Ganache Tart: Pretty good. It, of course, tasted like chocolate. Nothing really remarkable.

I'm confused why everyone calls this place charming. It is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you. It is not charming to hear their conversation like you're having it with them, struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you, and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave.

If you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.

Wow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.

Just 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.

So we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....

Orders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.

Chicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.

BBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.
 
The food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. 

It is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.

Go grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place.

The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!

Oh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!

So you're almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don't worry, just grab her by the arm and she'll try to remember to refill your drink.

My husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.

Soon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  

We both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again..",review,2,7o7MF9B9lxcWupE8jiLOaQ

I've tried this place twice now hoping that things would be better and that I just ordered the wrong items but I was, yet again, very disappointed. The only thing this place has going for itself is that they have large portions.

As for the food, it should be called Tex""ass"" Grill!

First time I visited, my boyfriend and I ordered the ribs meal. The ribs were dry and extremely salty. The sides weren't any better either. Their potatoes were bland and coleslaw was over-dressed. 

Seeing the highly rated reviews on their Chicken Fried Steak, I hoped my most recent visit would bring redemption to this restaurant, but, boy was I wrong!

Their Chicken Fried Steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes! They didn't bother to season the meat and it seems like it was just dredged in season-less flour batter. The gravy was flavorless as well. 

I really wanted to like it but my taste buds fought against me. I felt dirty trying to take another bite because I kept trying to fool myself into thinking I tasted the meat... or the batter... or the gravy... or the potatoes. My last bite of redemption... the biscuit.... which was also flavorless! What happened to buttery, flaky biscuits? They would be well inclined to consult the Pillsbury Dough Boy for some pointers because those taste 100% better.

Rings me up; my receipt is in hand. Calls for Manager to bring out my furniture to my car. 

Manager brings me the wrong kitchen stool. Well, he says, this is the one you bought. Hmmm.. there must be a mistake. Let me show you. I take him all the way to the store display and I tell him what happened. You see, Manager, you are trying to sell me the orange stool on display NEXT to the blue one that I bought. He says that probably some customers just moved around the price signs and he is right. I persist. Why are you trying to say I bought the stool NEXT to mine when I already showed you the price tag for MY stool and you rang me up already? You see, the one NEXT to mine still has it's price tag attached. If I were trying to buy that one..well..your cashier would have it in his hand. We debate back and forth. I question him, if the signs were shuffled around why would there be two price signs for the stool NEXT to mine?  You see each stool already has its own price tag correctly attached as you just reviewed each one. He's stoic. Well, what's the price then? Hmm.. he doesn't know and he goes back to look it up. Turns out it is $50. I don't understand. An associate was just working with me and confirmed that $30 was the price. 

Manager is adamant that customers probably just moved the signs around. I pointed around the furniture displays. Okay. Where is the $50 sign then? Was it shuffled around? Nope. No $50 sign anywhere. Just 4 stools, 4 price tags all at $30. My stool had a $30 sign, I brought it up front, paid for it and you are saying that this was a signage error? Your sales staff didn't seem to notice.

17868,kEqcAtMaC6hcY8Wbi1nxtA,5,2010-03-11,4,tXFad97WK4M7LrSWTzvacA,1,"Let me start by saying, historically, I like Best Buy. I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. 

This review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. 

Like I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. 

The washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently ""broke down"" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to ""resolve"" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.

But, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. 
I called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. 

I then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final ""pulled strings"" to ""accommodate"" my original delivery request. 
But...it's not over yet. 

The second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. 

I don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. 

So my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it.

I took my computer to Best Buy to get it recycled.  Computer parts are super toxic and should NOT be thrown into the trash.  They wanted to charge me $10 to recycle it.  Someone step out there and pass a dammed law saying that recycling charges must be included in purchases, for the love of god.  It doesn't take a genius to determine cause-and-effect incentive structures and figure this out.  Oh, tangent.

But I didn't have to pay $10, because they were going to charge me $20 to remove my harddrive, and that apparently trumps the recycling charge.  $20.  TWENTY.  It's 4 screws.  That's it.  That's $5 per screw.  I asked him if i could just borrow a screwdriver and I'd do it right there.  He said no.  So I went to try and find a screwdriver for purchase in the store.  The only one came in a $30 computer toolkit set.  Defeated, i retreated back to the Thief Squad and paid them $5 per screw, which took them all of 40 seconds, and left harddrive in hand and $20 lighter.

Why only one star???  I used their 0% financing for 24 months option, in which Sleep America has an arrangement with CitiFinancial services.

CitiFinancial Services will not send you contract documents and say that you got them, the will hit you with fees and late fees, even when you pay on THEIR website before it's due.   And when you call to dispute it, you get someone from a foreign country who doesn't have a firm grasp of the English language, therefore, they don't understand that if you make a payment BEFORE your due date, that it is not late.

First off, the oil leak was ""repaired"" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  

So, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my ""service engine"" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my ""service engine"" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.

Now, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.

I would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.

Have had issues with the car, drivers window quit working, so they told us to let the guy who was replacing the windshield know. We did, the guy fixed it, we were on our way. 

Came time to make our first payment, which they told us wasn't due for another two weeks, and then a few days later was supposedly due and late, and informed us that we owe them now for the drivers side window. And since we were late, it ""threw up red flags"" for them. Really?! So not coming through on your cheap little 500 mile warranty didn't throw up ""red flags"" for us as consumers? Whatever.  

These people are very shady. Do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you. They are money sharks and will not help you whatsoever in good faith. Shop around and stay away from them. The only reason we didn't give the car back is the 1000 dollars we had already paid. We are just going to go to our regular mechanic now, and deal with them as less as possible.

Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. 

Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! 

Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! 

I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. 

You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. 

There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...

I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. 

I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. 

Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? 

I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? 

The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! 

Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. 

I did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. 

I can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! 

Is this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? 
NO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. 

Bathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. 

Would I return? 
No but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first.",review,1,Y6nFfP2v17y5hqEmZp05Mw

My partner and I live in Central Phoenix and had friends from San Diego in for a visit last weekend.  After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great cafés in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.  They can keep their lousy service, inedible over priced food and ""cluck it"".",review,1,L-nRso3TdfX3QGZTUH4oew

I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a ""hi, we'll be right with you"" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the ""Call for service"" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the ""kid"" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the ""less than educated"" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.

CVS seemed like a safe option after my insurance plan and Walgreen's parted company, but has proven to be anything but. It has now taken seven different attempts to get a simple prescription refill, one that was easily filled correctly the first time at Walgreen's with no issues. 

CVS has said it was ready when it wasn't; filled it with less medication than the prescription specifies; argued over what the prescription calls for;  told me on one visit that it was not covered in my plan without even checking; finally recognized they had not done it correctly and said they would; notified me it was ready to pick up and then called back to say oops, they needed more time to get the rest of it in; notified me that the new version was ready for pick up only to give me the old, incorrect version and  then go to the back to find the newer version of it, which I purchased, only to find they had gotten closer to being correct but had once again shorted me on the medication.

This review is especially for their Scottsdale location at Shea/Scottsdale Road, but it really applies to all of their locations as I have used many of them over the years.

I lived in the Phoenix Area for more than 40 years before my current job took me to Southern California.  During that time I drove vintage cars and always wanted them to be looking nice.  In the mid-nineties, the car wash that I had frequented 2-3 times per week for years changed hands and the quality just fell apart.  I had noticed Danny's all over town, and decided to give them a try.

They were spectacular in those early years.  I got great service, everyone was friendly, and you didn't have those annoying ""how about a detail, oil change, upgrade to first class"" upselling as you drove up.  You chose, you paid, you hung out in a nice place while they really cleaned your car up nice.

Then somebody got greedy...  At first, there was this attack of the upsell elves coming up to your car and asking you if you wanted to buy more stuff, sometimes two-to-three times.  I fended them off at first, but they became so persistent that I complained, and well, I got a bewildered ""it's our right to make money"" attitude from them, so I basically started looking elsewhere and just used them when I was desperate.

Cut to the present.  I came back this last weekend to visit family, and my volvo wagon was a mess.  Kid, dogs and busy wives lead to a critical mass where the car just needs to get washed once a month.  I had some time so I took it to Danny's which was close by.  Bought the ""Royal"" wash which set me back nearly 30 bux.  I was sure my car would be clean enough to build a satellite in when I got it out the other side.

Well, after being chased around the exterior waiting area by bees for 45 minutes, I finally saw the attendant waving his rag at me that my car was done.  Or at least to their standards.

But not mine, oh heaven's no.  There was still bird poo on the roof.  When I pointed this out, the guy sheepishly griinned and made a half-hearted attempt to rub a few of them off with a rag.  When I scratched at a couple with my nail and they just came away, he just shrugged his shoulders.

We were in  a hurry at this point, so we just got in and sped off.  But wait, there's more.  While we were driving back to the house, we noticed that they hadn't vaccuumed around the inside of the car in any ""not so hard to reach"" areas like the center console or under the front of the seats.  I can sometimes forgive not getting in the nooks and crannies, but there was still TRASH in some of the places.  

Looking around more, I noticed that the car's interior handn't really been ""protected"" with the goo they use -- the tops of the doors, the dash top, and that's about it.  The center armrest was filthy and definitely not clean, and the back seats were still dry as a bone.  I noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome.  As I was dodging the killer bees I watched in amazement as the chrome bumper of a very large Ford pickup was polished like the mirror of the Hubble Telescope.

But they are totally phoning in the work on the family car.  My 8-year-old Volvo is far from a beater, but it doesn't compare to some of the exotic French and Italian stuff I used to have.  I still feel it should get the same attention, especially at $30.",review,5,eZ4ISr7SJzLFSELjFUGhBQ

The Dannys salesperson, Jorge, presented the complete detail package and although I explained I didn't have time to do it then the hard sale included ""we'll give you 3 free quick washes you can use 1 now, and come back for the detail when you have time. The price started high, then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined. Finally came down to the ""I give you good deal if you do it now, includes complete interior and exterior wash, engine clean, and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork"". Out of exhaustion, sympathy for the people waiting in line behind me, vacuum people waiting ahead of me, and really needing the detail anyway, I gave in, signed the form, gave them my credit card, used my ""free"" quick wash and was on my way.

I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal, but apparently since he hadn't circled it, it wasn't really included. Jorge says ""I can't give that for free, you'd have to talk to the manager"". When I asked for the managers name, he seemed surprised that I would actually do it, so I did.

If you care about actually having your car washed, this is NOT the place to go. I have been a faithful customer to this specific location for 3 years since moving into the Biltmore. I used to get my gas, oil-changes and vehicles washed here, but time and time again (chance after chance), my car was left to air dry, rims never cleaned or towel dried, forgotten about the air freshener, etc. I've even had to ask on multiple occasions to have the window writing wiped off before I drove off. It is clearly the most unorganized group of employees I have every witnessed at a car wash facility. I'm a reasonable guy, but when you see a vehicle that happens to be a newer make or model take Presidence over yours (even though you paid the same) it is NOT okay. An on-sight employee gave me Heather's (Danny's Daughter) number in the Corporate office, that I ended up leaving 3 messages for, requesting a call back to bring the latter to her attention. A week later, I received a call back from the receptionist saying that she is TOO busy to return my calls. A week after that call, a random number called my phone 602-694-2244 and a man, (Brian) informed me that Danny does not want my business anymore. I was appalled and tad confused... Brian had no knowledge of my ongoing experiences. I am to this moment embarrassed for him that he would even be instructed to make such a ridiculous  call. This is a lot to read, but if it helps you to make a more informed decision and avoid some serious frustration, let alone having to get your car re-washed, then great!

We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he ""only gets a complaint once every 2 months"" and that he has a ""packed house."" He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said ""whatever"" and left, shortly returning with our refund.
Food:
-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty
-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned

-Rude, arrogant owner
-Bland,over-priced food

The one thing people in customer service know is the customers pay your bills! Without them you're broke and out of business! That is why It doesn't matter if it's a $2 check or if business is doing so well that you don't need or care for any new customers, you should always treat the last customer just as good, if not better, than the first.

We went in here to get shadescreen material for our windows...I called ahead, asked if they had the correct kind and was told by a very nice guy that they did indeed have what I was looking for.  I have been recovering from surgery and I was not able to walk or drive, so I got my dad to help me out by driving me over and going inside to do my ""legwork"".  Instead of coming out with a bundle of shadescreen material, my dad came back out of the store looking annoyed.  He said they didn't have the material and the guy in the back wanted to know the name of the guy that I spoke with.  Oops.  Sorry I didn't get his name, but if you say you have the material, why has it suddenly disappeared?

So, since we were sitting in our car in the handicapped spot just in front of the store, I decided to call and ask to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone up at the front cash register, so I could see him from our car.  I asked him what was going on and why this material was not there when I'd spoken to the guy earlier, blah blah blah.  He didn't apologize.  He didn't go check.  Didn't offer to correct the mistake by finding a store that might have it.  Nope...he said *I* must have made a mistake.  When I told him I was currently handicapped and it took a lot of effort to get to his store and that I'd called ahead precisely for that reason, he said he couldn't do anything about that and hung up the phone.

I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the ""corporate recipe"", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their ""signature"" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away.

I considered doing this with the bone but felt that the gristle and fat would do her harm.

I have been consigning at My Sister's Closet for many years (the past 10) and I have had many disappointments along the way as a consigner.  I have dropped off many high-end designer clothes to both the Scottsdale and Phoenix locations throughout the years.  Something that always bothered me was after consigning really expensive new or never worn pieces, I could not locate them anywhere in the store, yet the sales associate always told me they were still an open item on the floor.  The most recent bad experience I had was when I consigned a YSL 2-pc. jacket and slacks from Neiman Marcus.. 2 weeks after I consigned it at the Camelback location, I would periodically stop by to see if the itmes I consigned sold.  The YSL had not sold and showed still open on the floor, but I never found it anywhere.  I checked with sales associates who looked in lay-a-way, but said it wasn't there.  Before the 60 days for consignment was up, and on day 52, I decided to get my pieces back and pay the fee.  The items were nowhere to be found in the store and this is not the first time this has happened.  I looked at every single piece of clothing along with a sales associate.  When I asked to speak to the store manager or one of the owner's, I suddenly received a call back two days later where I was told my YSL outfit was found.  When I asked where?  I was told right there on the front designer rack.  I think not!  I'm not stupid and after taking my merchandise back, I wrote a letter to one of the owner's to at least give her the opportunity to respond.  It's been over 2 mos. and I have not heard one word.  Not one apology, not one explanation, nothing.  So I have decided to never consign with My Sister's Closet ever again, because they simply don't care, and as far as I'm concerned, they lack good cusomer service skills.

The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.

First the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasn't terribly helpful and told me that he couldn't schedule anything, but he would send my call to one of his ""technicians.""  Okay.

A couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone, asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.

He came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me, ""either I come in an hour or on Monday.""  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather, so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.

Then he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasn't given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I can't have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course, this fellow still hadn't told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.

When he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didn't answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldn't leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldn't repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not, and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.

He then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised, but he didn't fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left, he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didn't tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.

The new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair, but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor, and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didn't have to have someone else come by, I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.

This particular technician was so horrible I am afraid to call this company ever again. He was rude to me and to my husband and",review,2,x4eIi_YiwKj1pzcspeLt-Q

This is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.

I should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.

With a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved ""clean"" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.

If the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again.",review,2,v8prSSKtN8-avfAUO0ZYkQ

He has $$$$$  to lose if people heed my warning and avoid his practice.  I have proof from THREE other vets that his diagnosis was WRONG.  If my dog had blood in her eye, it would be there the next day, too.  I took her to a chiropractic  vet in AZ the next day.  After adjusting her, he looked in her eye with an instrument.  NO BLOOD.  
Plus, Bishop  did not bother to look at my dog, or check her over in any way.  NOTHING.  NADA.   He just announced very DIRE supposed concerns that required IMMEDIATE and EXPENSIVE procedures in HIS OFFICE, without any initial exam, or even listening to me about her history. All of this based on the fact that she was coughing.  He completely ignored my every word.  It is true she was knocked by a bigger (not huge, about 10 lb.) dog.  Yet he ignored that, until his rebuttal now.  He did not look at her little back or legs, etc., to see if they were sore or bruised,.  After I took her to the chiropractor in AZ (who sadly isn't on Yelp, as he is expensive but SUPERB and worth every penny) she was much better.  I also was concerned about the Flovent she was on and the Dr. in CA (who also checked her eye WITH AN INSTRUMENT unlike Bishop) said she was having a reaction to it.  In Fact, Bishop said he knows NOTHING about Flovent and then ignored my concern about it.  So it's odd he brings it up now.  He just kept yelling how she's obviously in heart failure.    It nauseates me that some vets do this to loving pet parents, esp. when their baby is getting older and they get more concerned.  But as I said, as a rescuer, I'm a pro at this by now, and know when I'm being given a grotesque sales pitch.   I give good reviews when they're warranted.  I have NO reason not to. BTW, I'd been to the office of the ""specialist"" he was going to refer me to (read my review on the Vet. Specialists in Gilbert).  NO THANKS.

We explained we have a coupon from their website. The quote was for 4 rooms, a hallway and a stair case and was between $125-150 (each room was $15 and the coupon, which I have saved off of their website says that pre-treatment is included). John also reassured us that the price would be the same as in years past (we've used them for 3 consecutive tenants), except that there is a $10 trip charge they've recently started charging. 

On the day of the cleaning (the following day), the technician who visited the townhouse called me and told me the price would be $195. I explained to him that we had a quote of $125 to $150 and that in years past the cost was $115 (so we expect the cost will be $125). The technician told me that the price of $125 is accurate, but there is $70 of pre-treatment, which was a deal (he told me it would normally be 700 ft at $.20). I explained that the coupon says pre-treatment is included and when he said it wasn't, I told him that I am sorry but that is not what I was quoted and he should go home. The technician then asked me ""well what are you willing to pay""? He was clearly upset and told me at least twice that he just drove 40 miles. I explained that it isn't my fault that they service an area so far from the trucks or that his boss drastically misquoted the price. He then asked me if I'd pay $180, ""no"", how about $170, ""no"", how about $160, ""no"", how about $150, ""fine"". At that point I wanted to stop arguing with him as all of this was occurring with my brand new tenant (2nd day in unit) present as he took the day off of work to be home with the technician. I figured I'd call John after, explain to him that we had paid $115 each of the previous 2 years, and that we could just adjust this to $125. 

When I called John, I got basic belligerence. He first told me that he asked my wife how dirty the carpet is. Not sure what that means, but that was never asked. Plus the quote was $125-150 with an assurance that it would be the same price as last year plus $10. When I attempted to reason with John, he called me a liar (re: what the coupon on his website says), my wife a liar (re: her statement that he never asked how dirty the carpet was) and never responded to why the cost wasn't the exact same as previous years, plus $10 like was quoted. John wouldn't let me speak and just spoke over me, stating he never should have quoted me (with which I agreed). The carpet was in the exact same shape (several stains) as it was after previous tenants. Zee Best couldn't remove the stains in years past and I didn't expect them to this time (which they didn't). I just wanted a clean carpet (i.e. no dirt) for my new tenant. The conversation ended with John finishing yelling at me and promptly hanging up.

She drives up and the pitch begins.  What can I get for $85?

Two and a half hours later, the car comes back, it looks very nice from a distance, all shiny and trim and  tires blackened.

Suggestion for Lindstrom.  It's okay to sell your services and to upsell.  Badgering and pressuring customers however, is not okay.  It's better to work with your customers, and within their budget.

I should have read the Yelp reviews before we  decided to try the ""famous French Restaurant"", We had reservations at 8:00 and arrived a little late(8:10) . We were greeted and told to wait . Finally the hostess returned and took us to the dining room that had only a few tables in use. After sitting without menus, water bread or attention for some time we finally received service. The menu looked good with some French favorites and with some southwest flavor as anticipated. We ordered wine( good list) and later ordered foie gras and rack of lamb. We got our wine and a bread basket with ""famous croissants"". OUR FIRST MAJOR disappointment. The brown bread was warm but old and tough. The croissants were tiny, old, tough. (Pillsbury could have done better).
 The foie gras arrived with a nice presentation. When we had ordered we had asked if toast points would accompany the foie gras and the waitress said no that we had the bread basket. We asked if some sort of toasted bread could be brought(e.g. baguette). she said she would see if something was available.   The foie gras had four pieces of the brown bread that were burned. The foie gras was a normal piece of sauteed liver on a slice of pineapple. There was nothing about the dish that made you lick your lips(as we usually do with foie gras). The sauce was bland, the pineapple was not grilled, and for some reason they added a few sliced cherry tomatoes on the plate.
The rack of lamb arrived again with a nice presentation:  scalloped potatoes, green beans and peas, and cauliflower florets. Small quantities but reasonable. The lamb ribs had been sliced with au juice. The rack was miniature with small thin medallions, appropriately medium rare, but not a good quality lamb.The best item on the dish was the red pepper jelly on endive. 
We did not take a chance on dessert,  paid our bill and departed. We knew now why there so few customers on a Friday night.  We also asked about Vincent as we were leaving.(We thought he might have retired or sold). We were told that Vincent was in France.

I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.

This is the wonderful help i've gotten.
Dr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.

The receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. 

I can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they ""tried"" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?

Then there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.

And the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. 

And then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. 

The long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all.

I recently rented a lawn mower from this store. The employe I dealt with told me the $75 deposit would be refunded with cash upon return. 
I returned to find a different employe who informed me that the policy was actually refunding my card at days end. 
I explained that I was told differently, he offered neither apology nor explanation, just told me to check back tomorrow. 
No refund the next day. No refund the day after. In the meantime, I had a returned check at my bank due to funds not being there (thanks HD) and incurred a $35 fee. So I returned, was given the run around and demanded a manager. This guy was worse than his employees! Told me ""if you can't afford the deposit, maybe you should rent elsewhere!"" He then promised to refund my card that day and I left. Well well well, imagine my surprise when checking my account the next morning, I discovered not a credit, but another $75 charge! And with this, another $35 back fee! 
Needless to say, I angrily returned to speak with the HD manager, and he rudely informed me it was out of his hands and I had to call corporate headquarters. Thanks to the fraud department at my bank, I finally got my money back, but it took 4 weeks, and $70 in bank fees. The initial cost of rental was great, but due to misinformed employees and a careless manager, the experience cost me $70 extra, countless hours of my life, and a world of frustration.

The waiting room was not very clean and the furniture was worn and outdated.  While I was waiting, people were being rushed out the door who had just had their Lasik procedure done.  The staff were walking them out telling them their aftercare plan in front of the whole waiting room.  When the ""sales girl"" finally called me back into a room she did not apologize for the wait.  She only said, ""this is surgery day.  We are busy.  We tried calling to reschedule you (I received no such call). Then she made me look into a machine while she looked at my eyes for about ten seconds.  She then led me to her sales office to talk pricing. She gave a very lengthy sales pitch and did a poor job pretending to listen to my concerns. I am nervous about having this procedure done and she made me more nervous.  She made it seemed like I needed to have the procedure done ASAP before my eyes got worse.  Then she made a morbid comparison to Lasik being equivalent to cutting her finger off.  Then she pushed a finger down and modeled to me what her hand would like missing a finger.  She would not offer specifics on pricing and kept throwing out numbers and percentages.  She made me feel rushed and like I had to decide today if I was going to go with them for the procedure. She discouraged me from using another form of payment other than their financing and kept throwing percentage rates around as to why she was right.  I asked for documentation stating the pricing and discounts available to me and she declined to produce any such document stating, ""This is not like buying a car.  I am not giving you any written pricing.  Anyway, the pricing changes all the time.  These are your eyes we are talking about and you only have two (like I didn't know that).""  She created a huge sense of urgency with getting the procedure done and kept repeating, ""You only have two eyes.""  She kept telling me what ""most people"" do, which is pay the day of the consultation and get the procedure done the following week.  She also told me she needed a $100 deposit before I left today if I decided to go with them.  I told her that her sales pitch was making me feel uncomfortable and rushed as I am in the early stages of exploring this procedure.  She became offended, defensive, and moody claiming it was not a sales pitch and that ""I only have two eyes."" She would not even continue the consultation and have my eyes tested to see if I was even a ""candidate"" for Lasik without my committing to pay.  I then said that I felt their company was not a good fit for me and she led me out.  I do not recommend this company based on my consultation experience.  I would not trust them with the actual procedure because they seem very concerned with getting people in and out of there as fast as they can to make $$$! If you do get the procedure done at this place, you should not pay more than around $1500 per eye because that's the final price I was verbally quoted at my consultation.

I'm not sure if the owner saw us pull up in a beat up truck and me walk in with my mom and neice and nephew, and assumed we were poor and I was un-wed with two kids!!  Or if she is just this rude to everyone.  I walked into the small cramped space and was ignored, so I started looking around.  She has a few examples of invitations on her back wall, so I started to look at those, I was not impressed.  I finally went over to her desk and she finanlly asked if we needed help.  I told her I just got engaged and wanted to see some examples of invitations and save the dates, and she told me I had to make an appointment.  There wasn't anyone in the store, she was very rude, and I could tell she was passing judgment on us.  She must not have seen the rock on my finger! Sure my parent's don't have a lot of money, hence the beat up truck we pulled into the parking lot in.  But my paren't aren't paying for my wedding.  My fiance and myself are, we are getting married at the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago (I was visiting family in AZ and wanted to involve my Mom in some of the planning).  If she wasn't so judgemental and allowed us to look through some examples we may have used her, all though I wasn't impressed with the few examples she did have on her wall!  She has no idea what my budget was and if she did know I'm sure she would have treated us better, but to be honest I wouldn't want to give someone like that my buisness.

I love our old one, but he's a little far from our house...so, I started by getting recommendations from my area parenting board (the best board EVER). From there I narrowed it down to 3 offices and despite my broken arm, took Truman in his Service Dog vest off to check them out in person. I had a fairly dreadful experience at Dr. Michael Zacher's office. For those of you that don't know, I am a disabled person with a service dog. He is a hypoallergenic poodle and extremely well behaved. I was instructed by Dr. Zacher's Office Manager Rhonda that my dog was not welcome in their office (which by the way is beautiful with tv's, comfy leather sofas and a children's play room). I explained to her that under federal law, a Service Animal cannot be denied access to a facility. And, that I have NEVER in all my time with him (going on 3 years) been asked to leave. I can assure you that I am a very pleasant, nice (even fun) person. Truman was nestled near my feet having a snooze while this happened. He was not in any way disruptive. She told me that she would ask Dr. Zacher. About 15 minutes later Rhonda called back and told me the 'there was not a good fit', and that I could not use Dr. Zacher for my dental needs. I am very upset at being treated in this manner. After all if I had come in with a cane, would I have been denied access?

I brought my shih-tzu here to be groomed by Sylvia and when I picked my dog up he was shaking and visibly upset.  When we got home, he wouldn't walk, run, play, or even go to the bathroom or eat and drink.  My dog is two years old, this is very out of character for him.  I knew something was wrong with his back leg because he wouldn't put weight on it, and upon closer inspection I noticed that the entire inside of his leg had been cut up by the clippers.  His skin was raw and bleeding, and there were other spots on his back that looked the same.  I immediately called Petsmart and they told me to come back and they would reimburse me.  I returned the next day and asked that they have their vet check him out as well, because the situation had not improved over night.  They agreed to refund me and have the Banfield vets look at him.  I ran home to get my dog, and brought him back.  When I arrived, I was told I would be next in line, right after the dog in front of me because he was an emergency.  Ok, not a problem.  Then another dog was seen and helped, then another dog, so I finally went up and asked how long I could anticipate to sit there waiting on a Sunday afternoon.  The woman couldn't give me an estimate and told me I would have to wait until all of the appointments were seen first.  I, once again, asked to speak with the manager, who does nothing for managing situations whatsoever, and he told me that because they are a separate business, they couldn't do anything about the wait.  Needless to say, I left.  For $56 + $10 in tip, I can find a groomer who will treat my dog correctly and humanely, and I will not have to worry about them coming home injured.  I will never return to Petsmart for grooming, nor will I set foot in this Petsmart for anything again.

I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, however, we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here. In summary, we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w/ our friends and family.  My husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before NYE to help us decide if we should spend NYE there. He did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website, the Lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month.  He called to verify and to see if we needed reservations, the woman who answered was quite nice, he said, and confirmed the start time of the entertainment. How fun, we thought! We dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this Lounge; we went wednesday december 28, 2011 and arrived at 6pm. The grounds are absolutely beautiful-we were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to The Lounge.  First off, we walked in, there was no hostess/host, no one to greet us- not knowing if we were in the right place, we looked around and at that time a waitress (or maybe the bus girl?) practically ran past us, clearly not wanting to be side tracked.  My husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking away/running away, she said that there wasn't any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the ""bar supervisor"". My husband and I looked at each other wondering, huh? So we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses, Kathryn and i think another bar person. We stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us, which they didn't, so after a few awkward seconds my  husband  asked them if this was the place, etc...Truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation; we felt, at this point, very unwelcome and it hadn't even been 5 minutes since we arrived. We were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there's no flamenco entertainment here.  They all looked at each other to ask themselves, is there flamenco entertainment here? One said no, the other one had no idea and Kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside. All this while, no one was speaking to us, there were speaking amongst themselves. We found this to be extremely rude, impolite and uninviting. I think my husband asked if food was served there, Kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall (TCooks) that served food.  We felt pretty uninvited there, like she was shooing us away, actually now that i think about it, so we walked to TCooks and realized that we weren't in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to The Lounge. We didn't get a 'welcome back' or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit. The waitress Kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order. The hors d'hoerves were good, but I have to mention this: when the ""bus girl'? I didn't get her name served us the food, not a word from her. My husband politely said, ""Thank you"" as she served us the food and still not a word back from her. She's the one that nearly ran us over -i noted her above. All in all,  I'm not sure what was going on w/ their service staff,  I really feel they just didn't want to be there and secondly,  they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service.
Rude, impolite, unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there. Definately not a place we will return to-that includes the resort.

So I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!

So take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.

Now, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.

If there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.

Anyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.

I called in advance for an appointment. I went in and was led to the Relaxation Room by the very friendly Spa receptionist. I had arrived ten minutes early for the appointment, hoping she could take me sooner and I could be on my way sooner. There was not one other person in the Relaxation Room with me. There also isn't a wall clock and I soon found out why. 

My extra ten minutes pass. No waxer approaches me. Another ten minutes go by and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs wondering what is going on. I decide to go up front and see what the deal is. The receptionist says she will find out and I tell her I have places to go and can't wait much longer. I go back to the relaxation room...which is now not at all relaxing. Five more minutes pass....the receptionist comes to say she's sorry and the waxer will be right with me. It was at least another five, maybe even ten, and I was boiling mad. The waxer finally strolled in and of course the waxing itself took a whopping 2 minutes.  Sure she was nice enough but she was almost half an hour late for my appointment. The receptionist didn't think it was worth comping me the $13.50 cost so the waxer received no tip. 

The second time I used the Spa was when I injured my back in one of the classes and had to run, crying, out of the class. There is no Sports Medicine person on staff as far as I was aware so I hobbled to the Spa and found the receptionist in the back of the salon. I begged for a massage therapist to help me and she told me no one was there and massages didn't start until 9AM. This, by the way was at about 8:10AM. I'm standing in front of this woman, having trouble breathing and crying uncontrollably and she's telling me to wait an hour? Finally she figured out I was NOT kidding and said she'd call around to see who could come in ASAP. She helped me into a chair in the very UN-relaxing room and I wept alone there for about 15 minutes. She happened by the door again after that and said that a masseuse would be there in 15-20 minutes. I had no cell phone, watch or wall clock to measure that time, nor was any other help offered so I just continued weeping. It was 8:30AM (I'm guessing) when another spa-goer arrived for her day of treatments and went into the locker room to change. I managed to get in there as well (after a bit) and ask her if she knew the time. 8:45AM. 

Obviously my massage therapist didn't show up until 9AM. That would be too bloody much to ask when one has a crippling back injury. Sure the massage was decent (not in price mind you). I just feel like my time and money are completely unappreciated and I absolutely will not return there. By the way, the showers in the spa area are TERRIBLE.

So, when I called back to get the renewal, Stacey told me that Dr. Cruz wanted Minnie to have lab work for $98 (he originally told me $198) before he renewed the script. I asked for what? She said, she didn't know. I re-explained that I am still unemployed and that when I find a job, I will bring her back in for an exam. Dr. Cruz got on the phone and immediately told me that he would not renew this script. As a health care professional for nearly 20 years, I asked him, ""why do you need this blood work when this script is prevention....it will not cure a heart murmur?"" He became angry and said that he did not want any liability. He further told me that my ""unemployment status was not his problem."" He said ""I won't renew her meds unless you get the blood work. Sorry, I can't help you..."".Then, he yelled, ""get a job!!!!!"" Then, he hung up! I called back and he answered and continued to scream at me.  I asked again, what is the blood work for? He again refused to answer me and hung up once more. I am reporting his behavior to the Arizona Medical Examining Board. I have talked to two pharmacists and a doctor and all three told me that the script should have come with renewals for at least 90 days. I have been taking an ace for seven years and have a annual check up....my doctor gives me a six month supply. He is an ASS! He will only be friendly to you, if you can line his pocket.",review,1,hroDwMIuEE4OwPvEBAMEaA

Ive lived in Arcadia for years and have gotten a spot out front once. The valets are great but if you're just running in for 5 mins it adds another ten to get your car back. 
What frustrates me more than anything is there lobby/order pickup area. First they have crammed so many shelves full of rare peanut butters, custom greeting cards, children's educational toys, and hand made wine bottle holders that there is literally one small area for everyone to make an elementary school style line weaving through all this junk. Second, after ordering your $10 sandwich you are forced to wait in a crush of people all clamoring for their food. On more than one occasion my food has been taken by a hungry soccer mom or avid bicyclist in spandex. Then off to the cafeteria style seating to find a table. 
My problem is if your spending over $10 for their food items then they should give you a number to take to your table so its delivered, not fight cougars in a game of life and death for your meal.

I am on the fourth set of glasses which translates into 6 trips to Nationwide Vision Center.  Six trips for one item!  How many chances do you give a professional business to deliver on one $ 800.00 item?  Ok, maybe I assumed they were a professional business.  I have a simple bifocal subscription.  When I ordered I asked for glasses without the lines on the lenses.  I also asked for glasses that worked like sunglasses outside and regular glasses indoors.  I was given a bill and I paid my portion and was told I would be called when the glasses were ready.  I called two weeks after ordering my glasses and was told the factory made an error and the glasses were sent back to the factory.  A week later I called and the glasses were ready.  When I put the glasses on everything felt a little wobbly but I was told there is an adjustment period. I was not wearing the glasses for driving so it was a couple of days before I noticed there was not a sunglass effect standing in the sun.  Disappointed I took the glasses back.  The representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and call me when they were ready. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch hour I was once again let down.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.  I told her that I want a refund and NO I am not trying the glasses on.  She said she would get her manager.  I sat there for 15 minutes waiting.  I then met with Diana the Manager.  I clearly stated that I wanted a refund.  I was patient and they had three chances to correctly produce my glasses and they could not get the job done. Diana then stated that she would personally take care of my glasses and that they would be correct.  She said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience I had been experiencing.  She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her in the eye and replied that I was a letter writer.  If the glasses were not correct I would contact Nationwide Vision Center corporate headquarters, Facebook and any forum available to express my dissatisfaction with Nationwide Vision Center product and service.  I picked up the glasses on 6-14-13.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked the glasses and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told again that there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  When we went inside again I asked her if all the features I ordered were on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana stated again that the glasses were what I ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office. When you go in to pick up glasses you should expect it to be an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.  Diana discounted $39.99 on the glasses.  When I got home that night and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses did not darken.  The lenses have a purple/rose colored hue when I am indoors and outdoors. I did not detect a change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.  I will return tomorrow morning and get my refund. 
I went back the next morning (6-15-13) to return the glasses.  The representative put them under a special light they had and presto the glasses got very dark.  We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I asked the customer service representative why the glasses were a purple/rose hue outside in the sun and not grey.  I ordered gray and I had expected to see grey.  He said no that is the gray (yes the Emperor has clothes).  He then added that the lenses are effected by heat and the lenses will not get as dark outside in Phoenix as they would in Flagstaff.  He repeated it again that if I go to Flagstaff the glasses would be significantly darker.  I do not live in Flagstaff, I live in Phoenix and I purchased my glasses in Phoenix and I expect them to work in Phoenix.  The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I have not been able to darken the lenses to the level they did in the store with their special UV light.  I left the glasses out in the direct sun for 2 hours.

They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it ""to go"" as we were running out of time.
